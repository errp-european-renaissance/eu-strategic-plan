# Europe’s Path to Power: A Strategic Blueprint for a Multipolar World

**Introduction:** Europe stands at a crossroads in a rapidly emerging multipolar world. To assert itself as an independent global power, the European Union (EU) must rethink long-held security arrangements, rebuild its defense and industrial capacity, secure energy and technological sovereignty, and chart an autonomous foreign policy. This comprehensive strategy proposal outlines how Europe can transform its geopolitical posture – from recalibrating NATO relations to fostering energy independence – with bold actions and investments that solidify European sovereignty and influence.

## 1. Geopolitical Strategy & NATO Reevaluation

**Reassessing NATO’s Role:** NATO has been the bedrock of European security for decades, but European leaders increasingly question whether its U.S.-led structure aligns with Europe’s own interests. French President Emmanuel Macron warned that NATO was “brain-dead” in 2019, reflecting frustrations that Europe’s strategic priorities can diverge from Washington’s. The feasibility of _restructuring or even dissolving NATO_ is now a subject of debate in Europe’s capitals. While outright dissolution is extreme, many argue for empowering a **European pillar** within NATO or creating a new European defense alliance. The goal would be to ensure Europe can defend itself and pursue stability on its own terms, rather than remain “shaped by the notion that Europeans have unfairly benefited…while freeriding on American security guarantees” ([Facing Trump’s tariff war: A defensive blueprint for the EU | ECFR](https://ecfr.eu/article/facing-trumps-tariff-war-a-defensive-blueprint-for-the-eu/#:~:text=Since%20his%20first%20term%2C%20Donald,front%20is%20anything%20but%20straightforward)). Europe needs the ability to act independently if U.S. commitments waver. Notably, a second Trump presidency or U.S. pivot to Asia could drastically reduce support for Europe ([Defending Europe with less America | ECFR](https://ecfr.eu/publication/defending-europe-with-less-america/#:~:text=,the%20next%20decade%20that%20combines)), so Europe must be prepared “to take more responsibility for its own defence” ([Defending Europe with less America | ECFR](https://ecfr.eu/publication/defending-europe-with-less-america/#:~:text=reliance%20on%20the%20US.%20,package%E2%80%9D%2C%20including%20the%20combat%20support)). In practice, this means developing a plan to replace or reform NATO by the 2030s, preserving collective defense among Europeans even if U.S. involvement lessens.

**Phasing Out U.S. Bases:** A bold element of this strategy is to _remove U.S. military bases from European soil_ in favor of European-controlled installations. Currently, the U.S. maintains dozens of bases and tens of thousands of troops across Europe ([Where Are US Military Bases in Europe? - Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/us-military-bases-europe-locations-2032281#:~:text=Where%20Are%20US%20Military%20Bases,in%20the%20continent%20but)). These forces have enhanced European security but also symbolize Europe’s dependence. European publics and some leaders have begun to envision a security architecture where Europe isn’t host to foreign troops in perpetuity. If U.S. forces were to withdraw (whether by European choice or American decision), Europe must fill the gap. That entails Europe establishing its own forward bases and rapid reaction forces. A scenario analysis by security experts notes that a U.S. drawdown would force Europe to “explore a new force posture” and treat a U.S. withdrawal as an impetus to build independent capabilities ([Defending Europe with less America | ECFR](https://ecfr.eu/publication/defending-europe-with-less-america/#:~:text=Defending%20Europe%20with%20less%20America,US%20military%20support%20for%20Europe)). _Replacing U.S. bases with European bases_ would be a massive undertaking – requiring investments in infrastructure, logistics, and personnel. However, it would also demonstrate European strategic autonomy. European NATO states are already acknowledging they “can no longer lean on the United States” so heavily and must “scale up the continent’s weapons production” and military integration ([Scaling up Weapons Production, Integrating Armed Forces | Internationale Politik Quarterly](https://ip-quarterly.com/en/scaling-weapons-production-integrating-armed-forces#:~:text=Thus%2C%20European%20NATO%20states%20must,landscape%20in%20Europe%20and%20beyond)). Over the next decade, Europe could gradually assume control of key bases (for example, in Germany, Italy, Spain), while creating new joint EU military facilities. This should be coordinated through an EU or pan-European command to avoid fragmentation. The **estimated cost** for Europe to replace U.S. basing might reach tens of billions of euros for construction and relocation, but it is a necessary investment in autonomy. Germany’s recent pledge to become the “backbone of deterrence and collective defence in Europe” ([Germany pledges to make its military 'the backbone of defence in Europe' | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-pledges-make-its-military-the-backbone-defence-europe-2023-11-09/#:~:text=,Pistorius%20said)) – backed by a €100 billion fund to modernize its forces – illustrates that European states are willing to spend heavily to bolster defense. Similar commitments across the EU could collectively fund the infrastructure needed to host European forces where American bases once stood.

**Toward a European Nuclear Deterrent:** Under NATO’s nuclear-sharing arrangements, U.S. nuclear weapons are hosted in Europe, and the continent relies on the U.S. strategic umbrella. To truly control its destiny, Europe must evaluate _replacing U.S. nuclear warheads with a European-controlled deterrent._ In practice, this means building on France’s force de frappe (France’s independent nuclear arsenal) and potentially involving the UK or even Germany. German leaders have broached this once-taboo idea: **Friedrich Merz, a leading German politician, argued that Europe “must find new ways to defend itself without the U.S. military” and should look to Britain and France for nuclear safeguards ([Europe targets homegrown nuclear deterrent as Trump sides with Putin – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-nuclear-weapons-nato-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-friedrich-merz/#:~:text=Europe%27s%20politicians%20are%20openly%20discussing,transatlantic%20alliance%20under%20Donald%20Trump)) ([Europe targets homegrown nuclear deterrent as Trump sides with Putin – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-nuclear-weapons-nato-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-friedrich-merz/#:~:text=could%20no%20longer%20be%20relied,on)).** In Merz’s words, America “could no longer be relied on,” so European nuclear sharing or a joint deterrent should be on the table ([Europe targets homegrown nuclear deterrent as Trump sides with Putin – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-nuclear-weapons-nato-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-friedrich-merz/#:~:text=In%20what%20would%20be%20a,its%20nuclear%20protection%20through%20NATO)). France has already hinted at willingness to extend its nuclear umbrella – President Macron noted that French vital interests have a “European dimension,” inviting dialogue on how French nukes could help protect Europe ([Defending Europe with less America | ECFR](https://ecfr.eu/publication/defending-europe-with-less-america/#:~:text=match%20at%20L958%20nuclear%20dialogue,Baltic%20states%2C%20Poland%2C%20and%20Germany)) ([Defending Europe with less America | ECFR](https://ecfr.eu/publication/defending-europe-with-less-america/#:~:text=three%20Western%20nuclear%20weapon%20states,usefully%20complement%20nuclear%20deterrence%20by)). While the UK possesses nuclear weapons, its trustworthiness (discussed below) is debated. Germany, for its part, remains a non-nuclear state under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, but could contribute financially or technologically to a _European nuclear program_ led by France. Some analysts suggest a Eurodeterrent could be made credible by combining UK and French arsenals under a unified European command ([Europe targets homegrown nuclear deterrent as Trump sides with Putin – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-nuclear-weapons-nato-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-friedrich-merz/#:~:text=Europe%20targets%20homegrown%20nuclear%20deterrent,as%20Trump%20sides%20with%20Putin)) ([Europe targets homegrown nuclear deterrent as Trump sides with Putin – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-nuclear-weapons-nato-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-friedrich-merz/#:~:text=Friedrich%20Merz%20said%20his%20country,Jun%2FGetty%20Images)). This would require unprecedented cooperation and political agreement, but it’s not infeasible in the long term. The **feasibility** of a German nuclear weapon is politically low and would undermine non-proliferation efforts, so a more viable path is expanding French capabilities with shared EU funding or guarantees. By 2030, Europe could aim to have a **European Nuclear Deterrence Initiative**, where France’s arsenal is explicitly tied to EU collective defense. As a confidence measure, NATO’s existing U.S. nuclear gravity bombs in Belgium, Italy, Germany, and other countries could be gradually removed once a European alternative is credibly in place. European leaders will need to carefully manage this process to avoid strategic gaps – likely keeping U.S. nuclear guarantees as a backstop until a European deterrent is fully credible. Still, the long-term vision is clear: a Europe that _“benefits from a unique set of US nuclear sharing arrangements” but no longer depends entirely on them, instead complementing and strengthening its own deterrent options_ ([Defending Europe with less America | ECFR](https://ecfr.eu/publication/defending-europe-with-less-america/#:~:text=in%20the%20Nuclear%20Ban%20Treaty,except%20France)) ([Defending Europe with less America | ECFR](https://ecfr.eu/publication/defending-europe-with-less-america/#:~:text=the%20US%20nuclear%20guarantee%20would,also%20mitigate%20the%20most%20extreme)).

**Trustworthiness of the UK:** Brexit and Britain’s tight alignment with U.S. policies raise a sensitive question – _can the UK be relied upon in a truly European security framework?_ The UK remains a military heavyweight in Europe and a nuclear power, but it increasingly acts in tandem with Washington (“Global Britain”) rather than with the EU. Some observers note that post-Brexit Britain appears “more like a shadow of the US in Europe than a leader of Europeans” ([Does Europe have strategic autonomy? - ThinkChina.sg](https://www.thinkchina.sg/politics/does-europe-have-strategic-autonomy#:~:text=Does%20Europe%20have%20strategic%20autonomy%3F,in%20Europe%20than%20a)). The AUKUS pact (UK-U.S.-Australia security partnership) and Britain’s enthusiastic support of U.S. stances (from confronting China to expanding NATO) have caused unease on the continent. For an autonomous Europe, the UK’s interests may not always align – London might prioritize the U.S. “special relationship” over European strategic autonomy. Consequently, this strategy treats the UK as an important partner but acknowledges a trust deficit. European policymakers should **include the UK where interests align** (for example, joint exercises, intelligence sharing, coordinating on Russian aggression), but **build core European defense structures without depending on British participation.** If the UK demonstrates greater openness to European-led initiatives (for instance, the UK could engage with the EU’s defense projects or a European Security Council concept), it would bolster trust. However, until then, the EU should assume that continental Europe (plus like-minded states such as France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and potentially Turkey) must be capable of acting without British help. The door remains open for the UK to be part of a stronger European defense identity – indeed, some in Britain argue London should not dismiss European “strategic autonomy” efforts ([The UK must not dismiss European 'strategic autonomy'](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2022/02/uk-must-not-dismiss-european-strategic-autonomy#:~:text=The%20UK%20must%20not%20dismiss,EU%20and%20key%20member)). But Europe’s plans for sovereignty should be robust even if the UK opts out or sides with Washington in a crisis. In practical terms, this means Europe proceeding with its own army or intervention forces; if the UK joins later, it’s a bonus, but not a prerequisite.

**Recommended Actions (Geopolitics & NATO):** Europe should convene an EU-led security forum by 2025 to plan for _“Defence Europe 2030”_ – a roadmap to gradually assume NATO’s responsibilities with European forces. This would involve: (1) **Negotiating new NATO terms** or a successor alliance that gives Europe command authority and independence (with an option to activate full European command if U.S. support falters); (2) **Investing in European military infrastructure** – at least €30 billion over the next 5 years – to upgrade bases and C4ISR systems so that EU forces can replace U.S. units seamlessly; (3) **Launching a Eurodeterrent Task Force** to explore pooling France’s and (potentially) the UK’s nuclear capabilities under a European defense pact, with Germany and others contributing funding (e.g. a dedicated €5 billion annual fund) to modernize these arsenals ([Europe targets homegrown nuclear deterrent as Trump sides with Putin – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-nuclear-weapons-nato-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-friedrich-merz/#:~:text=In%20what%20would%20be%20a,its%20nuclear%20protection%20through%20NATO)) ([Defending Europe with less America | ECFR](https://ecfr.eu/publication/defending-europe-with-less-america/#:~:text=nuclear%20dialogue%20with%20European%20states%2C,Baltic%20states%2C%20Poland%2C%20and%20Germany)); and (4) **Engaging the UK in dialogue** while simultaneously building an EU collective defense that can function without Britain. By taking these steps, Europe can reshape NATO’s legacy into a security architecture suited to European interests – one that deters aggression on the continent but leaves Europe firmly in control of its destiny.

## 2. Military and Defense Industrial Rebuilding

**Rearming and Reinforcing Europe’s Militaries:** Decades of underinvestment have left many European militaries ill-prepared for high-intensity conflict ([Defending Europe with less America | ECFR](https://ecfr.eu/publication/defending-europe-with-less-america/#:~:text=Summary)). The war in Ukraine was a wake-up call, exposing “the sorry state of European militaries and defence industries” and “their deep reliance on the US” ([Defending Europe with less America | ECFR](https://ecfr.eu/publication/defending-europe-with-less-america/#:~:text=Summary)). To be an independent power, Europe must undertake a concerted military rebuilding. _Germany, in particular, needs to revive its weapons industry and armed forces._ Once Europe’s frontline during the Cold War, Germany drastically cut defense production and spending after 1990. Now Germany recognizes it must become a security leader: Berlin’s new defense guidelines pledge to make the Bundeswehr “the backbone of deterrence and collective defence in Europe” ([Germany pledges to make its military 'the backbone of defence in Europe' | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-pledges-make-its-military-the-backbone-defence-europe-2023-11-09/#:~:text=,Pistorius%20said)). Germany has already created a €100 billion special fund to purchase modern weapons and committed to exceed NATO’s 2% GDP spending target ([Germany pledges to make its military 'the backbone of defence in Europe' | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-pledges-make-its-military-the-backbone-defence-europe-2023-11-09/#:~:text=German%20Chancellor%20Olaf%20Scholz%20announced,the%20workings%20of%20the%20Bundeswehr)). These funds should prioritize _rebuilding Germany’s domestic arms industry capabilities_ – from tanks and artillery to advanced electronics and missiles. German defense firms like Rheinmetall, Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, and Hensoldt can expand production if regulatory and funding barriers are eased ([Scaling up Weapons Production, Integrating Armed Forces | Internationale Politik Quarterly](https://ip-quarterly.com/en/scaling-weapons-production-integrating-armed-forces#:~:text=In%20the%20past%2C%20state%20regulations,term%20purchase%20guarantees)) ([Scaling up Weapons Production, Integrating Armed Forces | Internationale Politik Quarterly](https://ip-quarterly.com/en/scaling-weapons-production-integrating-armed-forces#:~:text=Current%20procurement%20processes%20are%20unnecessarily,Bundeswehr%20within%20just%20six%20months)). In the past, Germany’s cumbersome procurement and unstable budgets hindered its arms companies ([Scaling up Weapons Production, Integrating Armed Forces | Internationale Politik Quarterly](https://ip-quarterly.com/en/scaling-weapons-production-integrating-armed-forces#:~:text=In%20the%20past%2C%20state%20regulations,term%20purchase%20guarantees)). Now, the government’s new **National Security and Defense Industry Strategy (2024)** proposes multi-year advance orders and financing tools to give industry certainty to invest ([Scaling up Weapons Production, Integrating Armed Forces | Internationale Politik Quarterly](https://ip-quarterly.com/en/scaling-weapons-production-integrating-armed-forces#:~:text=To%20overcome%20the%20current%20hurdles,%E2%80%9D)) ([Scaling up Weapons Production, Integrating Armed Forces | Internationale Politik Quarterly](https://ip-quarterly.com/en/scaling-weapons-production-integrating-armed-forces#:~:text=German%20government%20put%20forward%20a,%E2%80%9D)). Implementing this is critical. By guaranteeing large, long-term orders (10+ years) for equipment and munitions, Germany can achieve economies of scale and innovate. For example, rather than ordering a few dozen tanks at a time, Germany and partners should collectively order hundreds, allowing factories to run at full capacity. The EU is also moving to create a **“European market for defense goods and services”**, aiming for member states to jointly purchase at least 40% of their defense equipment and spend 50% of their budgets on European-made products by 2030 ([Scaling up Weapons Production, Integrating Armed Forces | Internationale Politik Quarterly](https://ip-quarterly.com/en/scaling-weapons-production-integrating-armed-forces#:~:text=To%20advance%20this%20agenda%2C%20the,to%20products%20manufactured%20within%20Europe)). Achieving this will strengthen the continent’s autonomy and reduce fragmentation. In sum, Germany’s rearmament acts as the linchpin: if the EU’s largest economy develops a robust defense industry base, it can supply not just itself but smaller European states as well, decreasing reliance on U.S. imports. The strategy calls for an EU **Defense Industrial Program** to fund joint R&D and procurement, possibly via common EU debt ([Scaling up Weapons Production, Integrating Armed Forces | Internationale Politik Quarterly](https://ip-quarterly.com/en/scaling-weapons-production-integrating-armed-forces#:~:text=To%20underline%20the%20importance%20of,significant%20opposition%2C%20particularly%20from%20Germany)) ([Scaling up Weapons Production, Integrating Armed Forces | Internationale Politik Quarterly](https://ip-quarterly.com/en/scaling-weapons-production-integrating-armed-forces#:~:text=To%20advance%20this%20agenda%2C%20the,to%20products%20manufactured%20within%20Europe)). Over the next decade, Europe should invest an additional €20–30 billion in defense R&D and manufacturing capacity to ensure sufficient stocks of everything from precision-guided missiles to drones. This will make European forces more self-sufficient in any crisis.

**Integrating Turkey into European Defense:** _Turkey’s military capacity_ – the second largest in NATO – is an asset Europe cannot afford to ignore. Turkey boasts a standing army of over 400,000, a robust defense industry (producing tanks, drones, missiles), and a strategic location bridging Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. As Europe builds an autonomous defense, including Turkey would tremendously enhance its strength. Despite political frictions, **Türkiye** (Turkey) remains a “major NATO ally” that could “help strengthen the European security architecture” ([In strengthening its security architecture, Europe shouldn’t discount Türkiye’s role - Atlantic Council](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/turkeysource/in-strengthening-its-security-architecture-europe-shouldnt-discount-turkiyes-role/#:~:text=T%C3%BCrkiye%2C,could%20help%20play%20a%20role)). Turkish forces have significant combat experience and high operational readiness from conflicts in Syria, Iraq, and counterterrorism operations ([In strengthening its security architecture, Europe shouldn’t discount Türkiye’s role - Atlantic Council](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/turkeysource/in-strengthening-its-security-architecture-europe-shouldnt-discount-turkiyes-role/#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20T%C3%BCrkiye%E2%80%99s%20defense%20capabilities%20could,significant%20combat%20experience%20and%20high)). Turkey has also invested in innovative defense technologies, especially unmanned aerial vehicles – its _Bayraktar TB2 drones_ proved effective in recent conflicts and could fill gaps in European capabilities ([In strengthening its security architecture, Europe shouldn’t discount Türkiye’s role - Atlantic Council](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/turkeysource/in-strengthening-its-security-architecture-europe-shouldnt-discount-turkiyes-role/#:~:text=match%20at%20L433%20technologies%2C%20T%C3%BCrkiye%E2%80%99s,these%20new%20systems%2C%20the%20Turkish)). However, Turkey is outside the EU and has drifted at times toward Russia, raising questions about its alignment. This strategy proposes _reintegrating Turkey into Europe’s defense framework_, potentially through renewed EU membership talks linked to security cooperation. While full EU accession for Turkey is fraught, a pragmatic approach could be a _European Security Partnership_ where Turkey joins EU defense initiatives (like PESCO projects or a European Intervention Force) in exchange for deeper strategic ties. The Atlantic Council notes that **non-EU allies like Turkey are essential, and suggests establishing an EU security mechanism that includes non-EU countries** because “security in Europe is impossible to envisage without” them ([In strengthening its security architecture, Europe shouldn’t discount Türkiye’s role - Atlantic Council](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/turkeysource/in-strengthening-its-security-architecture-europe-shouldnt-discount-turkiyes-role/#:~:text=The%20CSDP%20was%20designed%20by,and%20defense%20system%20with%20NATO)). A concrete step would be inviting Turkey to participate in the proposed European Defense Union as an associate member, with a role in joint planning and exercises. Militarily, integrating Turkey means Europe gains access to İncirlik air base, the Turkish Navy (critical for the Black Sea and Eastern Med), and a large pool of troops. To make this feasible, Europe should address Turkey’s concerns: accelerate modernization support for Turkey’s forces (perhaps co-developing next-gen tanks or air defenses) and coordinate on regional threats (like stabilizing Syria). **Including Turkey in a European Army** would also require Turkey to recommit fully to Western security ideals and possibly recalibrate its foreign policy (e.g. maintaining distance from Russia’s military systems like the S-400). The benefits, however, are immense – a Europe-Turkey security union would project power from the Atlantic to the Middle East. Furthermore, Turkey’s leverage over migration (discussed later) could be managed more effectively if Turkey is inside the tent of European cooperation rather than outside. Politically, bringing Turkey closer might require a leadership change or evolution in Ankara, but laying the groundwork now (such as inviting Turkish officers to EU military staff exchanges, or involving Turkish industries in EU defense projects) can set the stage. In terms of _timelines_, Turkey could be gradually integrated into EU defense drills by 2025–2026, and in a scenario where Turkey aligns with EU values, a pathway for EU accession and a full defense union membership by the early 2030s could be envisioned.

**Reducing Dependency on U.S. Weaponry:** European militaries today rely heavily on American-made equipment – from F-35 fighter jets and Patriot missiles to Apache helicopters. To be truly autonomous, Europe must wean itself off this dependency by developing and procuring _indigenous European military technology_. This involves both boosting intra-European programs and collaborating with other trusted partners like Japan and Canada (who share Europe’s democratic values without dominating its decisions). The good news is Europe has a strong foundation: companies like France’s Dassault and Germany’s Airbus are working on a **next-generation fighter jet (FCAS)**, while a European MALE drone and a new Main Battle Tank project (MGCS) are in development. The EU’s goal of 50% of defense procurement spending on European products by 2030 underscores this shift ([Scaling up Weapons Production, Integrating Armed Forces | Internationale Politik Quarterly](https://ip-quarterly.com/en/scaling-weapons-production-integrating-armed-forces#:~:text=To%20advance%20this%20agenda%2C%20the,to%20products%20manufactured%20within%20Europe)). Achieving it means _prioritizing European bids even if U.S. options seem readily available._ For example, instead of buying American F-35s, Europe could invest in extending the Eurofighter Typhoon’s capabilities or accelerating the FCAS timeline. Likewise, missile defense could be sourced from European systems (like France’s Mamba SAM or Italy’s CAMM) rather than U.S. Patriots. A coordinated plan for **European defense industrial autonomy** should identify critical sectors – e.g. fighter aircraft, armored vehicles, naval ships, cyber defense – and ensure at least two European suppliers exist for each. The European Commission has launched initiatives (EDIDP, EDF) funding collaborative R&D; these must be scaled up. Joint procurement is key: if multiple EU countries pool orders for a European system, unit costs drop and viability increases ([Scaling up Weapons Production, Integrating Armed Forces | Internationale Politik Quarterly](https://ip-quarterly.com/en/scaling-weapons-production-integrating-armed-forces#:~:text=Current%20procurement%20processes%20are%20unnecessarily,Bundeswehr%20within%20just%20six%20months)). Recent policy also calls for common procurement to replenish stocks depleted by aid to Ukraine, with EU financing to encourage buying “Made in Europe.”

In parallel, cooperation with _Japan and Canada_ offers a way to diversify supply chains without overreliance on the U.S. Japan is bolstering its defense industry (and loosening export restrictions) in response to regional threats, and has advanced tech in areas like robotics, missiles, and naval systems. The UK, Italy, and Japan have already teamed up on the “Tempest”/GCAP future fighter program – an example of transcontinental cooperation excluding the U.S. Europe could similarly partner with Japan on, say, submarine technology or electronic warfare systems. Canada, while typically a U.S. partner, has niche strengths (such as in satellite communications and armored vehicle production) and often aligns with European approaches. The EU and Canada have recently discussed enhancing security and defense cooperation ([The Canada-EU Leaders' Meeting: A New Era of Cooperation? | Wilson Center](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/canada-eu-leaders-meeting-new-era-cooperation#:~:text=The%20Canada,EU%20relations)) ([The Canada-EU Leaders' Meeting: A New Era of Cooperation? | Wilson Center](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/canada-eu-leaders-meeting-new-era-cooperation#:~:text=For%20decades%2C%20the%20European,based)). Practical projects could include joint development of Arctic surveillance technology (leveraging Canadian expertise and European sensors) or standardizing components so European and Canadian forces can share equipment. Both Japan and Canada value not being wholly dependent on U.S. defense supplies, so they have incentive to co-develop alternatives with Europe. By 2027, Europe should initiate at least 2–3 tri-party programs (EU-Japan-Canada) in fields like cybersecurity or space-based early warning, pooling talent and costs.

**Reinvigorating Defense R&D and Production:** Europe’s defense rebuild requires a surge in research, innovation, and manufacturing. During the Cold War, European nations maintained cutting-edge labs and factories; reviving that spirit is crucial. For instance, Europe should invest in emerging technologies like **AI-driven defense systems, hypersonic weapons, and next-gen cyber defenses**. The U.S. leads in many of these, but Europe can catch up by leveraging its civilian tech strengths (in AI, automotive engineering, etc.) for military use. Concrete measures include expanding the European Defence Fund beyond its current €8 billion (2021–2027) to perhaps €20 billion in the next budget cycle, targeting high-risk high-reward tech. _Scaling up weapons production_ is equally important: the war in Ukraine showed that Europe’s ammo and missile stockpiles were alarmingly low, and ramping up output has been slow. To fix this, governments might need to guarantee purchases well beyond wartime needs, giving industry confidence to build new assembly lines ([Scaling up Weapons Production, Integrating Armed Forces | Internationale Politik Quarterly](https://ip-quarterly.com/en/scaling-weapons-production-integrating-armed-forces#:~:text=To%20overcome%20the%20current%20hurdles,%E2%80%9D)) ([Scaling up Weapons Production, Integrating Armed Forces | Internationale Politik Quarterly](https://ip-quarterly.com/en/scaling-weapons-production-integrating-armed-forces#:~:text=If%20implemented%2C%20these%20proposals%20alone,seen%20little%20success%20thus%20far)). It’s recommended that the EU and member states establish a **munitions consortium** with a funded plan (e.g. €5 billion over 5 years) to produce millions of artillery shells and dozens of missiles per month.

Ultimately, a **Europe that arms itself** is a Europe that can act for itself. As one policy expert put it, Europe must _“wean itself off its overreliance on the US”_ by scaling weapons production and deeper integration of forces ([Scaling up Weapons Production, Integrating Armed Forces | Internationale Politik Quarterly](https://ip-quarterly.com/en/scaling-weapons-production-integrating-armed-forces#:~:text=Thus%2C%20European%20NATO%20states%20must,landscape%20in%20Europe%20and%20beyond)). By 2030, European forces should be equipped primarily with European-made fighter jets, armor, drones, and naval vessels, supported by a revitalized German-led industrial base and contributions from France, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and others. Turkey’s inclusion would add its formidable output (Turkey makes its own drones, armored vehicles, and soon fighter jets) into the mix. The combination positions Europe to not only meet its own defense needs but also become a net _exporter_ of security – able to supply allies and partners, and thereby extend its influence globally.

**Recommended Actions (Defense Rebuild):** Europe should move swiftly on defense integration: (1) **Launch a European Defence Industrial Renaissance program** – allocate ~€20 billion over 2024–2030 to fund joint projects (future tank, drone swarms, missile defense) and expand manufacturing lines ([Scaling up Weapons Production, Integrating Armed Forces | Internationale Politik Quarterly](https://ip-quarterly.com/en/scaling-weapons-production-integrating-armed-forces#:~:text=German%20government%20put%20forward%20a,%E2%80%9D)) ([Scaling up Weapons Production, Integrating Armed Forces | Internationale Politik Quarterly](https://ip-quarterly.com/en/scaling-weapons-production-integrating-armed-forces#:~:text=To%20advance%20this%20agenda%2C%20the,to%20products%20manufactured%20within%20Europe)). This includes utilizing the European Investment Bank to finance defense infrastructure ([Scaling up Weapons Production, Integrating Armed Forces | Internationale Politik Quarterly](https://ip-quarterly.com/en/scaling-weapons-production-integrating-armed-forces#:~:text=extent%20advance%20orders%20for%20the,%E2%80%9D)). (2) **Meet or exceed NATO’s 2% GDP spending now, aiming for 3% by 2030** for those who can – this extra spending (~€150 billion Europe-wide annually) should prioritize European equipment and R&D. (3) **Integrate Turkey step-by-step**: Immediately invite Turkey to observe or join EU defense coordination (PESCO) and co-develop a plan by 2025 for Turkey’s phased inclusion in a European Army framework, contingent on political alignment. (4) **Form strategic tech alliances** with Japan and Canada: by 2025 sign memoranda of understanding for co-development in areas like fighter engines (with Japan) and Arctic patrol ships or communications (with Canada). Reducing U.S. weapon imports by 50% by 2030 is a measurable target – replaced by European or allied alternatives. Through these actions, Europe can stand up a powerful, self-reliant military pillar that underpins its global power status.

## 3. Energy Independence & Economic Resilience

**Reevaluating European Gas Policy:** Energy is the lifeblood of economies, and Europe’s energy security has been shaken by geopolitics. The continent long relied on cheap Russian gas; Russia’s war on Ukraine and weaponization of gas forced a scramble for alternatives. In this context, _Europe must carefully reassess decisions like the closure of Dutch gas reserves and its growing reliance on imported U.S. gas._ The Netherlands’ Groningen gas field – once Europe’s largest natural gas source – has been nearly shut down due to induced earthquakes damaging local towns ([Dutch Senate delays Groningen gas field shutdown | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/dutch-senate-postpones-decision-groningen-gas-field-shutdown-2024-04-03/#:~:text=said%20production%20would%20never%20resume,of%20the%20risk%20of%20earthquakes)) ([Dutch Senate delays Groningen gas field shutdown | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/dutch-senate-postpones-decision-groningen-gas-field-shutdown-2024-04-03/#:~:text=Normal%20gas%20production%20at%20Groningen,has%20damaged%20thousands%20of%20buildings)). Production ended in 2022 except for emergency reserve use, and a law to permanently close it is pending ([Dutch Senate delays Groningen gas field shutdown | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/dutch-senate-postpones-decision-groningen-gas-field-shutdown-2024-04-03/#:~:text=AMSTERDAM%2C%20April%203%20%28Reuters%29%20,of%20the%20risk%20of%20earthquakes)) ([Dutch Senate delays Groningen gas field shutdown | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/dutch-senate-postpones-decision-groningen-gas-field-shutdown-2024-04-03/#:~:text=Although%20backed%20by%20the%20Lower,of%20the%20country%27s%20gas%20supply)). While safety concerns are real, Europe should weigh whether some controlled extraction could continue to bolster energy self-sufficiency during the transition to renewables. The Dutch Senate’s recent hesitation to finalize Groningen’s closure – asking for guarantees it won’t harm energy security ([Dutch Senate delays Groningen gas field shutdown | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/dutch-senate-postpones-decision-groningen-gas-field-shutdown-2024-04-03/#:~:text=a%20law%20that%20would%20close,1)) – shows a recognition that domestic supply still matters. Experts estimate only a low probability that gas shortages would force reopening, but even a _1 in 80,000 chance_ of severe supply risk was enough for some to delay the shutdown ([Dutch Senate delays Groningen gas field shutdown | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/dutch-senate-postpones-decision-groningen-gas-field-shutdown-2024-04-03/#:~:text=Vijlbrief%20said%20he%20would%20resign,Senate%20changed%20its%20mind%20quickly)). This strategy suggests **reconsidering a partial extension** of Groningen’s life (at minimal safe output) for a few more years, or at least maintaining it in a standby capacity. Doing so could provide a buffer and negotiating leverage in gas markets. In parallel, Europe should diversify within Europe – accelerating North Sea gas projects, Mediterranean gas (from Cyprus, Israel, Egypt via pipeline or LNG), and biogas development – to reduce the need for overseas LNG.

Over the past two years, Europe has massively increased imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG), much of it from the United States. U.S. LNG helped replace Russian pipeline gas, but at a cost: European gas prices spiked to multiples of U.S. prices during 2022–2023, straining consumers and industry. In 2024, **EU gas wholesale prices averaged nearly five times those in the US, and EU industrial electricity prices about 2.5 times higher than U.S. levels ([Decarbonising for competitiveness: four ways to reduce European energy prices](https://www.bruegel.org/policy-brief/decarbonising-competitiveness-four-ways-reduce-european-energy-prices#:~:text=Energy%20prices%20are%C2%A0higher%20in%20the,higher%20than%20in%20the%20US))**. This stark disparity erodes Europe’s economic competitiveness. The EU should therefore _avoid over-reliance on expensive U.S. gas in the long term._ American LNG is costly partly due to transport and also because the U.S. market doesn’t face the same prices – Europe has effectively outbid others to secure gas, benefiting U.S. producers. While U.S. LNG will remain part of Europe’s mix for energy security (and transatlantic solidarity), Europe should aggressively seek more affordable options: **signing long-term contracts with reliable lower-cost suppliers** (such as Norway, Qatar, Algeria, or even a post-war, reformed Russia under conditions) to stabilize prices ([EU seeks more US gas, renewable energy to replace Russian supplies | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/eu-seeks-more-us-gas-renewable-energy-replace-russian-supplies-2025-02-21/#:~:text=,LNG%20contracts%20to%20stabilize%20prices)) ([EU seeks more US gas, renewable energy to replace Russian supplies | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/eu-seeks-more-us-gas-renewable-energy-replace-russian-supplies-2025-02-21/#:~:text=BRUSSELS%2C%20Feb%2021%20%28Reuters%29%20,EU%27s%20energy%20commissioner%20has%20said)). Additionally, investing in _gas storage and network interconnections_ within Europe can mitigate price spikes by smoothing supply. The EU has already passed measures to prevent extreme gas price spikes and improve storage utilization. By 2027, Europe aims to quit Russian fossil fuels entirely ([EU seeks more US gas, renewable energy to replace Russian supplies | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/eu-seeks-more-us-gas-renewable-energy-replace-russian-supplies-2025-02-21/#:~:text=The%20EU%20has%20pledged%20to,Russian%20%2096%20last%20year)), so interim supplies matter. Ultimately, Europe’s goal is to **reduce overall gas consumption** by switching to renewables and electrification – every bcm of gas demand eliminated is one less bcm to import at high cost.

**EU Green Deal vs. U.S. Energy Strategy:** The EU’s Green Deal is a transformative agenda to make Europe climate-neutral by 2050, with ambitious 2030 targets for cutting emissions and boosting renewables. It emphasizes carbon pricing, renewable expansion, and efficiency – _prioritizing long-term sustainability and independence from fossil fuels_. The U.S., in contrast, has had a more oscillating energy policy. Under President Biden, the U.S. passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a $369 billion package supporting clean energy (similar in spirit to EU climate goals), but the U.S. also remains a top oil & gas producer and exporter. Under a potential Trump (or similar) administration, U.S. policy could swing back to “drill, baby, drill” and even hostility toward climate agreements. Europe must ensure its Green Deal does not inadvertently handicap its economy vis-à-vis the U.S. Already, **European industries pay far more for energy** – a fundamental competitiveness challenge ([Decarbonising for competitiveness: four ways to reduce European energy prices](https://www.bruegel.org/policy-brief/decarbonising-competitiveness-four-ways-reduce-european-energy-prices#:~:text=Energy%20prices%20are%C2%A0higher%20in%20the,higher%20than%20in%20the%20US)). High energy costs in Europe, partly due to reliance on imports and carbon pricing, can drive energy-intensive industries (chemicals, steel, etc.) to relocate to regions with cheaper energy (like the U.S., which enjoys low natural gas prices due to shale gas). Europe should adjust its Green Deal implementation to balance climate ambition with economic pragmatism. This could involve: providing transitional support or subsidies to vulnerable industries to offset high energy costs, accelerating innovation in clean technology to reduce cost (e.g. green hydrogen for steel), and considering temporary relief measures if energy prices surge (such as price caps or tax breaks). The EU is already taking steps – for example, discussion of a **“Net-Zero Industry Act”** to boost clean tech manufacturing in Europe, and loosening state aid rules to respond to the U.S. IRA incentives. Europe should not abandon its climate leadership (which is core to its values and future competitiveness in green tech), but it must ensure policies are smart. As one recommendation put it, the EU should pursue a “technology-neutral energy policy that delivers stable and globally competitive prices” while it decarbonizes ([New competitiveness deal should complement the EU's green ...](https://www.eesc.europa.eu/en/news-media/news/new-competitiveness-deal-should-complement-eus-green-transformation#:~:text=,The%20EU)). This might mean temporarily embracing nuclear energy and even domestic gas (as a bridge fuel) to keep prices manageable during the transition.

From a strategic viewpoint, _the Green Deal is also an answer to Russia’s energy leverage_. By cutting fossil fuel use, Europe undercuts the influence of petrostates. However, Europe shouldn’t become overly dependent on imported renewables components either (like Chinese solar panels or batteries) – otherwise it trades one dependency for another. The U.S. strategy under the IRA is to onshore clean tech manufacturing; Europe must similarly encourage domestic production of wind turbines, solar cells, batteries, and electrolysers. This requires aligning climate policy with industrial policy – e.g. using carbon border taxes to protect EU industries from dirtier (and cheaper) imports, and investing in supply chains (raw materials, processing) for renewables. Europe’s approach to decarbonization can thus double as a strategy for industrial renewal and resilience.

**Counterbalancing China’s Industrial Policies:** China looms large as both a competitor and partner in energy and industry. Beijing’s state-driven industrial policy – from Made in China 2025 to massive subsidies for electric vehicles (EVs) and renewables – has enabled it to dominate production of solar panels, batteries, and critical minerals processing. China also heavily subsidizes other sectors, giving its firms an edge globally. **Chinese manufacturing firms receive support equal to about 4.5% of their revenues – nearly nine times the rate of support for comparable companies in OECD countries ([EU Concerns About Chinese Subsidies: What the Evidence Suggests - Intereconomics](https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2024/number/4/article/eu-concerns-about-chinese-subsidies-what-the-evidence-suggests.html#:~:text=In%20line%20with%20the%20CSIS,market%20borrowing.4)) ([EU Concerns About Chinese Subsidies: What the Evidence Suggests - Intereconomics](https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2024/number/4/article/eu-concerns-about-chinese-subsidies-what-the-evidence-suggests.html#:~:text=These%20results%20suggest%20that%20through,quantify%20and%20to%20compare%20internationally)).** Such subsidies (cheap loans, tax breaks, etc.) have boosted China’s world market share in industries like steel, solar, and EVs. For instance, China became the world’s largest EV market thanks to “longstanding extensive support” including subsidies paid directly to manufacturers and requirements favoring local products ([EU Concerns About Chinese Subsidies: What the Evidence Suggests - Intereconomics](https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2024/number/4/article/eu-concerns-about-chinese-subsidies-what-the-evidence-suggests.html#:~:text=China%E2%80%99s%20rise%20to%20the%20world%E2%80%99s,than%20consumers%20and%20that%20they)) ([EU Concerns About Chinese Subsidies: What the Evidence Suggests - Intereconomics](https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2024/number/4/article/eu-concerns-about-chinese-subsidies-what-the-evidence-suggests.html#:~:text=While%20these%20purchase%20subsidies%20have,the%20period%202010%20to%202020)). This aggressive strategy poses a competitiveness challenge to Europe: European companies struggle to compete on price when Chinese rivals benefit from vast state aid and lower energy costs (often via coal-fired power). Furthermore, China’s control of critical materials (lithium, rare earths) and its growing technological prowess in areas like 5G or AI threaten to undercut Europe’s industrial base and even pose security risks.

To _counterbalance China while staying competitive_, Europe should adopt a multi-pronged approach. First, **strengthen its own industrial policy**: The EU has begun doing this with initiatives like the European Chips Act (€43 billion public-private investment to double EU semiconductor market share) ([Chipmaker CEO says Washington’s anti-China tech blockade is a bad idea – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-tech-sovereignty-china-peter-wennink-asml/#:~:text=The%20EU%2C%20which%20wants%20to,computing%20and%20other%20advanced%20technologies)), and plans for a Critical Raw Materials Act to secure supply of lithium, rare earths, etc. Europe needs to be willing to provide strategic subsidies of its own in key sectors – essentially a European answer to Chinese and U.S. industrial policies. This marks a departure from the EU’s traditionally strict state-aid limits, but it’s necessary in a world where others heavily support their industries. The European Commission recently proposed a vast **“European Sovereignty Fund”** to invest in green and digital industries, recognizing that U.S. and Chinese subsidies require an EU response ([The EU has a playbook to de-risk from China. Is it working?](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-eu-has-a-playbook-to-de-risk-from-china-is-it-working/#:~:text=working%3F%20www,imports%20that%20could%20threaten)) ([EU preps vast program of subsidies as it declares U.S. and China ...](https://fortune.com/europe/2024/04/18/eu-preps-vast-program-of-subsidies-as-it-declares-u-s-and-china-no-longer-playing-by-the-rules/#:~:text=EU%20preps%20vast%20program%20of,subsidies%20and%20tax%20breaks%2C)). By streamlining approval for national subsidies in important projects (IPCEIs) and mobilizing EU funds, Europe can ensure its firms remain in the race.

Second, **enforce fair trade and IP rules**: Europe should be tough on unfair practices – e.g. using trade defense instruments to counter dumping of underpriced Chinese products that “threaten…its manufacturing base” ([Facing Trump’s tariff war: A defensive blueprint for the EU | ECFR](https://ecfr.eu/article/facing-trumps-tariff-war-a-defensive-blueprint-for-the-eu/#:~:text=An%20initial%20step%20could%20be,that%20undermine%20its%20manufacturing%20base)). The EU has already launched an anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese EV imports in 2023, signaling it will not allow its car industry to be hollowed out by subsidized competitors. Similarly, Europe must protect its technology – coordinating with allies to press China on intellectual property theft and reciprocity. As ASML’s CEO noted, Europe should “get tough with China over intellectual property and enforce a level playing field in trade” ([Chipmaker CEO says Washington’s anti-China tech blockade is a bad idea – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-tech-sovereignty-china-peter-wennink-asml/#:~:text=Peter%20Wennink%2C%20head%20of%20Dutch,a%20strategy%20favored%20in%20Washington)) ([Chipmaker CEO says Washington’s anti-China tech blockade is a bad idea – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-tech-sovereignty-china-peter-wennink-asml/#:~:text=,the%20southeast%20of%20the%20country)), rather than simply ban exports. Targeted export controls on the most sensitive tech (like ASML’s extreme ultraviolet lithography machines, which Europe has restricted from China under U.S. pressure) can be maintained, but Europe should avoid a blanket tech decoupling that might harm its own industry. Instead, Europe could pursue **“de-risking”** – trading with China in areas that pose little security risk, but ensuring alternatives for critical dependencies. For example, Europe can keep importing Chinese solar panels to meet climate goals, but also invest in some domestic panel production for energy security. Or continue business with China’s consumer markets, but diversify sourcing of rare earths by developing mines in Africa or Australia with EU support.

Third, **cooperate with China where possible on energy transition**: Climate change is a common challenge; Europe might find common ground with China in developing green tech. If Europe can partner with China in areas like hydrogen technology standards or jointly finance renewable projects in developing countries, it can maintain a functional relationship while competing industrially. Europe’s engagement with BRICS nations (discussed later) also ties in here – working with China and others on reforming multilateral institutions can ensure Europe isn’t isolated. But Europe should always enter such partnerships from a position of strength – hence the emphasis on bolstering its own capabilities first.

**Maintaining Economic Resilience:** Beyond energy, Europe needs broader economic resilience. This includes **diversifying trade and investment** so no single country (whether the U.S., China or Russia) can blackmail Europe by withholding crucial goods. The pandemic and the war taught Europe about supply chain vulnerabilities – from medical supplies to semiconductors. The EU’s concept of _“Open Strategic Autonomy”_ embodies this balance: remain open to global trade, but be autonomous in critical areas. Concretely, Europe should localize production of essential pharmaceuticals, microchips (through the Chips Act), and defense items, even if it’s less “efficient” than outsourcing – because resilience has value. It should also stockpile critical commodities and maintain emergency capabilities (as it did by mandating gas storage filling each summer).

On the energy front, _the drive to renewables is not only about climate but also economics_: Renewables (wind, solar) produced domestically mean less money spent on fuel imports. Europe already generated 38% of its electricity from renewables in 2020, and aims for 42.5% of all energy from renewables by 2030 ([The diverse picture of energy in Europe](https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/Europe/The-diverse-picture-of-energy-in-Europe-236083#:~:text=The%20diverse%20picture%20of%20energy,Energy%20demand%20among%20European)). Pushing beyond that – coupled with energy efficiency – will reduce exposure to volatile fossil fuel markets. The EU Energy Commissioner recently stressed the need to “produce our own energy” rather than pay Putin; building out wind, solar, and green hydrogen at scale is crucial ([EU seeks more US gas, renewable energy to replace Russian supplies | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/eu-seeks-more-us-gas-renewable-energy-replace-russian-supplies-2025-02-21/#:~:text=,to%20Russian%20President%20Vladimir%20Putin)) ([EU seeks more US gas, renewable energy to replace Russian supplies | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/eu-seeks-more-us-gas-renewable-energy-replace-russian-supplies-2025-02-21/#:~:text=The%20EU%20has%20pledged%20to,Russian%20%2096%20last%20year)). Europe’s plan to fast-track permitting for renewables is a positive step ([EU seeks more US gas, renewable energy to replace Russian supplies | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/eu-seeks-more-us-gas-renewable-energy-replace-russian-supplies-2025-02-21/#:~:text=own%20energy%2C,to%20Russian%20President%20Vladimir%20Putin)).

Finally, Europe should guard against external economic pressure by **strengthening its financial autonomy**. This includes promoting the euro’s international use (so oil/gas and other contracts can be settled in euros, reducing dollar dependency) and having EU financial institutions that can operate if U.S. sanctions hit third parties. The European Stability Mechanism, development banks, or even a future European Monetary Fund could play a role in cushioning shocks independent of U.S.-led systems.

**Recommended Actions (Energy & Economy):** Key steps for Europe include: (1) **Implement RePowerEU fully** – invest the planned €300 billion in clean energy and infrastructure to hit the 45% renewables by 2030 target, cutting gas demand sharply. (2) **Adjust gas strategy** – secure 10–15 year LNG contracts with diverse suppliers to stabilize prices (locking in volumes when prices are low), and consider keeping Groningen on standby with minimal extraction until 2025-2026 to insure against supply crises ([Dutch Senate delays Groningen gas field shutdown | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/dutch-senate-postpones-decision-groningen-gas-field-shutdown-2024-04-03/#:~:text=AMSTERDAM%2C%20April%203%20%28Reuters%29%20,of%20the%20risk%20of%20earthquakes)) ([Dutch Senate delays Groningen gas field shutdown | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/dutch-senate-postpones-decision-groningen-gas-field-shutdown-2024-04-03/#:~:text=,a%20parliamentary%20hearing%20on%20Wednesday)). (3) **Protect industry during transition** – establish a €50 billion European Competitiveness Fund to help industries decarbonize (via electrification, hydrogen) and cushion them from high energy costs, preventing offshoring. Use carbon border adjustments to level the playing field with regions that have laxer climate policies. (4) **Enforce reciprocity and anti-subsidy measures** – swiftly deploy tariffs or quotas if trading partners flood the EU market with underpriced, subsidized goods that threaten strategic sectors (e.g. EVs, steel). Also pursue joint procurement of critical materials, and build strategic reserves of rare metals. (5) **Enhance EU-China engagement on fair trade** – push China in bilateral talks to reduce support for sectors where it causes global gluts; if not, coordinate with like-minded partners (G7) for collective pressure. In parallel, continue selective cooperation with China on climate projects to maintain dialogue. By executing these measures, Europe can ensure that its Green Deal strengthens rather than weakens its economy, and that it remains resilient amid global economic turbulence. The end-state is a Europe that powers itself with clean energy, fuels its factories with affordable electricity, and cannot be easily coerced through energy or trade dependence.

## 4. Technological Sovereignty & Industrial Policy

**Competing with U.S. Tech Giants:** Europe has long found itself in the digital age as a **regulator rather than a creator** of tech giants. American companies – Google, Apple, Facebook (Meta), Amazon, Microsoft – dominate markets and have few European equals. The EU has responded with strong regulations (GDPR for privacy, Digital Markets Act for fair competition, etc.), seeking to rein in Big Tech’s excesses. However, there is a growing concern that _Europe’s eagerness to regulate could inadvertently stifle its own innovation_. The continent’s “tech curbs are a double-edged sword” – they hold Big Tech accountable, but may also burden European startups with compliance costs that make it harder to scale up ([Are Europe's Tech Regulations Harming Homegrown Industry?](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/10/23/metaverse-europe-uk-us-big-tech-regulation-innovation/#:~:text=This%20approach%20has%20real%20consequences,the%20gap%20between%20the%20continents)). Critics warn that Europe might be “overzealous” in regulating new technologies and risk giving up on trying to **“win in tech”**, focusing only on controlling U.S. firms out of “ressentiment” ([Are Europe's Tech Regulations Harming Homegrown Industry?](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/10/23/metaverse-europe-uk-us-big-tech-regulation-innovation/#:~:text=The%20optimistic%20outlook%20is%20that,TikTok%20as%20the%20sole%20exception)) ([Are Europe's Tech Regulations Harming Homegrown Industry?](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/10/23/metaverse-europe-uk-us-big-tech-regulation-innovation/#:~:text=enough%20to%20matter,are%20in%20the%20first%20place)). Indeed, the EU’s Digital Markets Act identified 22 major online services to be strictly regulated – 21 of them were American (the exception being China’s TikTok) ([Are Europe's Tech Regulations Harming Homegrown Industry?](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/10/23/metaverse-europe-uk-us-big-tech-regulation-innovation/#:~:text=recently%20designated%2022%20%E2%80%9Ccore%20platform,TikTok%20as%20the%20sole%20exception)). This underscores Europe’s lack of homegrown platforms. Moreover, Europe has levied billions in fines on U.S. tech companies ([Are Europe's Tech Regulations Harming Homegrown Industry?](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/10/23/metaverse-europe-uk-us-big-tech-regulation-innovation/#:~:text=And%20who%20gets%20fined%20for,all%20taken%20turns%20forking%20over)), which may be justified enforcement, but it doesn’t in itself nurture European competitors.

To compete with Silicon Valley and Chinese tech giants, _Europe needs to foster a more innovation-friendly environment without abandoning sensible regulation._ Striking this balance means possibly **phasing or tailoring regulations** so that smaller EU firms are not overwhelmed. For instance, the upcoming AI Act – Europe is set to be the first to comprehensively regulate AI – should be careful to not over-regulate nascent European AI startups in the same way as trillion-dollar firms. The EU could consider safe harbors or reduced compliance requirements for young companies below a certain size, giving them room to grow. As some analysts suggest, the EU should “avoid premature regulation of emerging technologies, allowing them to develop before their innovation potential is contained” ([[PDF] The EU's Critical Tech Gap - DigitalEurope](https://cdn.digitaleurope.org/uploads/2024/07/DIGITALEUROPE-CRITICAL-TECHNOLOGIES-REPORT-FINAL_JULY_WEB.pdf#:~:text=,2)). A dynamic approach could be: stringent oversight for Big Tech (to prevent abuse of dominance), but lighter touch for smaller players coupled with support programs.

Another element is boosting **venture capital and scaling opportunities** in Europe so that the next Spotify or ASML can flourish. Europe has world-class research and startups (in areas like fintech, biotech, AI), but often they either fail to scale or get acquired by U.S. or Chinese firms. The EU and member states can facilitate more funding – for example, through the European Innovation Council, or sovereign tech funds – and create a true single market for digital services (so startups immediately have a 450 million consumer market, not 27 fragmented markets). Tax incentives for R&D and stock options reform (to attract talent) are also tools to consider.

**Open vs Closed: Aligning with BRICS or Russia on Tech:** In seeking tech sovereignty, Europe faces a strategic choice: to what extent should it collaborate with non-Western powers like _BRICS countries or Russia_? On one hand, teaming up with emerging economies could give Europe alternative sources of technology and markets, reducing reliance on the U.S. tech ecosystem. For example, cooperating with **India or Brazil** on digital public goods, or with **South Africa** on telecom infrastructure, might yield mutual benefits. On the other hand, aligning too closely with a Sino-Russian tech sphere could conflict with Europe’s values (e.g. on internet freedom) and jeopardize security (e.g. using Chinese 5G vendors raised spying fears). Given Russia’s current aggression and sanctions, tech cooperation with Moscow is largely off the table for now. But under “normalized terms” in the future – say a post-conflict, democratizing Russia – there could be niche areas (like space exploration or nuclear energy research) where resuming cooperation makes sense. It’s noteworthy that historically, European space agencies worked with Russia (e.g. launching satellites, joint missions) and European companies sold advanced machine tools and electronics to Russia. Normalization would allow resumption of such ties, which could serve as a counterbalance to U.S. or Chinese influence. However, this comes only if Russia fundamentally changes course; Europe cannot compromise its security or principles for technology deals.

With _BRICS and other emerging markets_, Europe should pursue what might be called “selective tech multilateralism.” That means engaging in initiatives like setting global tech standards in bodies where BRICS nations are present, ensuring they aren’t solely U.S.-led. For instance, Europe can work with India on inclusive internet standards or co-develop open-source AI for languages underrepresented online. The Egmont Institute notes that the BRICS expansion and activism is a wake-up call for the EU to engage the Global South in reforming global governance ([Why the BRICS Summit in Kazan should be a Wake-up Call for the EU - Egmont Institute](https://www.egmontinstitute.be/why-the-brics-summit-in-kazan-should-be-a-wake-up-call-for-the-eu/#:~:text=This%20policy%20brief%20examines%20the,alignment%E2%80%99%20to%20diversify)) ([Why the BRICS Summit in Kazan should be a Wake-up Call for the EU - Egmont Institute](https://www.egmontinstitute.be/why-the-brics-summit-in-kazan-should-be-a-wake-up-call-for-the-eu/#:~:text=to%20include%20Ethiopia%2C%20Egypt%2C%20the,effort%20is%20essential%20despite%20the)). In technology domains, that could involve supporting Africa’s digitalization in partnership with the African Union, rather than leaving it to China’s Belt and Road Digital Silk Road. Aligning with BRICS on some tech issues (like advocating for equitable global internet governance) need not mean aligning against the West – Europe can be a bridge. But Europe should be cautious not to become dependent on, say, Chinese hardware or Indian software to the same extent it was on U.S. platforms. The goal is _diversification_: have multiple options (Western, domestic European, and BRICS) so that Europe isn’t beholden to any single source.

**Leveraging European Tech Assets (e.g. ASML):** Despite the challenges, Europe possesses some crown jewels in technology. ASML, the Dutch company, is a prime example – it is the world’s only producer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, which are critical for manufacturing the most advanced semiconductors. This gives Europe significant leverage in the global chip industry. ASML’s CEO, Peter Wennink, has emphasized that having such a unique capability is a huge “bargaining chip” – _“You have to have something that others need”_ ([Chipmaker CEO says Washington’s anti-China tech blockade is a bad idea – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-tech-sovereignty-china-peter-wennink-asml/#:~:text=,Wennink%20said)). In fact, ASML symbolizes how **technological sovereignty** can provide geopolitical influence. Europe has wisely set a goal of controlling 20% of global semiconductor production by 2030 (up from 10% today) ([Chipmaker CEO says Washington’s anti-China tech blockade is a bad idea – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-tech-sovereignty-china-peter-wennink-asml/#:~:text=The%20EU%2C%20which%20wants%20to,computing%20and%20other%20advanced%20technologies)), building on strengths like ASML ([Chipmaker CEO says Washington’s anti-China tech blockade is a bad idea – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-tech-sovereignty-china-peter-wennink-asml/#:~:text=the%20goal%20%20of%20controlling,computing%20and%20other%20advanced%20technologies)). Achieving that involves supporting ASML’s growth and that of its suppliers, and attracting semiconductor fabs to Europe (as Intel, TSMC, and others are now planning, lured by incentives from the EU Chips Act). Europe should ensure ASML continues to innovate (next-gen EUV, high-NA lithography) by facilitating talent and resisting undue export controls that cut it off from markets. Wennink has argued against Europe blindly following the U.S. in banning high-tech sales to China, warning that _if Europe shuts out China, it will only accelerate China’s drive for self-sufficiency and Europe will lose market share_ ([Chipmaker CEO says Washington’s anti-China tech blockade is a bad idea – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-tech-sovereignty-china-peter-wennink-asml/#:~:text=tough%20with%20China%20over%20intellectual,a%20strategy%20favored%20in%20Washington)) ([Chipmaker CEO says Washington’s anti-China tech blockade is a bad idea – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-tech-sovereignty-china-peter-wennink-asml/#:~:text=,the%20southeast%20of%20the%20country)). Europe should heed this pragmatic view – maintaining trade with China (with protections for IP) to keep influence and economic benefit, rather than ceding that market entirely to domestic Chinese suppliers that will inevitably emerge.

Beyond ASML, Europe has other key tech companies: _Nokia and Ericsson_ (telecom equipment), _Siemens_ (industrial automation), _SAP_ (enterprise software), _STMicroelectronics, Infineon, NXP_ (semiconductors), _Airbus_ (aerospace), _Arm_ (UK-based chip design, though now owned by Japan’s SoftBank), and emergent players in biotech and AI. These firms are strategic assets. Europe must prevent them from being bought out or outcompeted unfairly. It might consider **blocking acquisitions** of critical tech companies by foreign (especially state-linked) entities if they undermine security – a more assertive use of investment screening. It should also help these companies scale in emerging tech: e.g., supporting Nokia and Ericsson in the 5G/6G race to ensure they stay ahead of Huawei; funding AI research through initiatives like CLAIRE to bolster Europe’s AI startups; and leveraging **public procurement** to give European tech an edge (for instance, European governments could favor European cloud providers for sensitive data storage, rather than defaulting to Amazon/Azure).

**Creating European Industrial Champions in AI, Semiconductors, Defense Tech:** Europe’s past shows that collaboration can yield world-class champions – Airbus in aviation and Ariane in space launchers stand as proof. Similar joint endeavors are needed now in new domains: _artificial intelligence, semiconductor manufacturing, quantum computing, and defense systems._ To create an AI champion, Europe could pool its AI research centers into a network (somewhat like CERN did for physics) and fund open-source large language models that rival Google’s or OpenAI’s, but align with European values (privacy, inclusion). The market for AI will be huge, and Europe shouldn’t only be a consumer. The EU’s upcoming AI rulebook can actually become a strength if Europe’s AI companies lead in “trustworthy AI” that the world demands – so investing in compliance-as-a-service and ethical AI innovation might turn regulation into a competitive advantage. Likewise, in semiconductors, aside from the Chips Act’s €43 billion ([European Chips Act](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-chips-act_en#:~:text=In%20total%2C%20more%20than%20%E2%82%AC43,term%20private%20investment)), Europe could encourage alliances between its national champions – e.g., a merger or deep partnership between France’s Soitec and Germany’s Infineon to create a European semiconductor powerhouse spanning materials to chips. In defense tech, as discussed, cooperative projects like the new fighter jet and tank will birth industrial champions (the way the Eurofighter consortium did). The key is steadfast political support and financing to bring these to fruition without succumbing to intra-European rivalry.

One area often overlooked is software and internet platforms – Europe lacks a consumer tech giant (no European Facebook or Amazon). While it may be late to create a social network from scratch, Europe can focus on _enterprise and industrial platforms_ where it has domain knowledge. For example, Europe can lead in _Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)_ platforms (connecting machinery, given companies like Siemens and Schneider Electric). It can also pioneer in _fintech and digital finance_, capitalizing on the EU’s integrated financial market and strong data protection to make EU a safe hub for digital banking and crypto innovation under proper rules.

Finally, Europe should harness its talent fully: that means **attracting and retaining skilled workers** in tech. Too many European engineers and scientists end up in Silicon Valley. Creating more opportunities at home through startup incubators, funding, and perhaps special visas to bring back European talent from abroad (and welcome skilled immigrants from elsewhere) is necessary. The EU’s population of 500 million is full of brainpower; with the right ecosystem, more “unicorn” companies will emerge.

**Recommended Actions (Tech & Industry):** (1) **Regulatory balance:** Modify the implementation of the Digital Markets Act and AI Act to include _sunset clauses or review points_ to adjust regulation as technology evolves, and institute SME exemptions where appropriate. In parallel, launch a €5 billion _EU Tech Growth Fund_ to scale up promising European startups to compete globally, so the regulatory burden is paired with direct support. (2) **Tech sovereignty initiatives:** Fully fund the European Chips Act (mobilize the €43 billion and perhaps expand it) to build fabs and R&D centers ([Chipmaker CEO says Washington’s anti-China tech blockade is a bad idea – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-tech-sovereignty-china-peter-wennink-asml/#:~:text=The%20EU%2C%20which%20wants%20to,computing%20and%20other%20advanced%20technologies)). Set a target to increase Europe’s share in global chip production to 20% by 2030, and monitor progress annually. Also establish a _European Cloud Alliance_ (Gaia-X project) that actually delivers a competitive cloud service by combining European providers – governments can commit to using this for public data to give it a market foothold. (3) **Prevent brain drain:** Create the _European Tech Corps_, a program offering top STEM graduates attractive packages (scholarships, startup grants, lab access) if they stay in Europe to build companies or research for a certain period. Additionally, adapt immigration rules to attract global tech experts – the goal: make Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam as attractive as Silicon Valley. (4) **Alliances beyond the West:** Engage with India’s tech sector via an EU-India digital partnership (the two already discussed cooperation on 5G and AI), and consider joint BRICS-EU tech forums on standards for new tech (so Europe is not shut out of standard-setting in emerging economies). However, remain firm on core values – for example, Europe should _not_ adopt China’s surveillance-heavy model of tech; instead, it can promote an alternative model globally. (5) **Industrial champions through cooperation:** Announce by 2025 two new major EU collaborative projects: one “Airbus of AI” (a consortium of companies and labs developing large-scale AI infrastructure in Europe) and an “Airbus of Quantum” (pooling resources for quantum computing, where no single EU country can do it alone). Fund each with at least €1–2 billion in public funds as seed money, to crowd-in private investment. In defense, ensure the Future Combat Air System and other joint programs stay on track with sustained funding, so they yield operational systems by the 2030s that keep Europe at the cutting edge.

By implementing these measures, Europe can regain technological sovereignty – not by isolating itself, but by empowering its innovators and ensuring it holds key cards (like ASML in chips, or leadership in AI ethics) in the global tech arena. Europe’s aim should be to be a rule-maker _and_ a market-maker in tech: setting standards **and** fielding its own successful tech firms that embody those standards.

## 5. Migration & Border Security

**Managing Migration Strategically:** Migration has been a contentious issue in Europe, testing the balance between humanitarian obligations and security concerns. To forge a sustainable path, Europe must implement a _comprehensive action plan that differentiates between migrants:_ swiftly deporting those who pose security threats or have no legal right to stay, while protecting refugees, legal residents, and the skilled or needed workers who contribute to Europe’s economy. The principle is **“firm but fair”** – Europe should be welcoming to those fleeing genuine persecution or filling labor gaps, yet resolute in removing criminal elements and those abusing the system.

_Deportation of criminal migrants_ is a priority for public safety and to maintain trust in the immigration system. Individuals from abroad who commit serious crimes in Europe should not be allowed to remain. This requires overcoming legal and diplomatic hurdles – often deportations stall because origin countries refuse to take people back or the individuals appeal under human rights laws. The EU can negotiate readmission agreements with key countries, leveraging trade or aid incentives to ensure cooperation in taking back nationals. Recent developments show movement: the European Commission is set to propose new rules to make deportations more efficient and clarify the obligations of migrants who have exhausted legal avenues ([EU to propose new migration rules in latest rightward shift – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-migration-propose-rules-right-wing/#:~:text=The%20European%20Commission%20is%20set,to%20three%20European%20Union%20diplomats)) ([EU to propose new migration rules in latest rightward shift – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-migration-propose-rules-right-wing/#:~:text=A%20few%20principles%20are%20likely,a%20significant%20amount%20of%20time)). One idea under discussion is to **restrict the freedom of movement of migrants slated for removal** by requiring check-ins at designated centers so they cannot abscond ([EU to propose new migration rules in latest rightward shift – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-migration-propose-rules-right-wing/#:~:text=Another%20possibility%20under%20discussion%20is,vanishing%2C%20the%20same%20diplomat%20said)). While such steps are sensitive, they can prevent situations where failed asylum seekers disappear into the shadows. The EU’s migration pact also aims to standardize who is deemed a “danger to national security” to expedite those deportations. It’s crucial, however, that due process and judicial oversight remain, to avoid wrongful removals. The European Court of Justice has ruled on cases regarding deporting refugees convicted of crimes, aiming to reconcile security with legal protections ([European Court of Justice Rules on Deporting Refugees Convicted ...](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/european-court-justice-rules-deporting-refugees-convicted-crimes#:~:text=European%20Court%20of%20Justice%20Rules,Wednesday%2C%20June%2026)). Europe should abide by its laws (not deporting someone to a country where they likely face torture, for instance) but within those bounds, criminal foreigners should be returned. Improved information sharing among EU states (via Schengen Information System, etc.) can ensure someone deported from one country doesn’t simply move to another.

At the same time, Europe must _safeguard those migrants who are legal or vital to its societies_. This includes refugees with valid asylum claims, long-term residents, and critical workforce migrants. Europe’s aging demographics mean it actually **needs immigration** – the EU and UK together could face a shortfall of ~44 million workers by 2050 without increased immigration ([Europe To Be Short 44 Million Workers by 2050 Without Increased Immigration, New Study Finds | Center For Global Development](https://www.cgdev.org/article/europe-be-short-44-million-workers-2050-without-increased-immigration-new-study-finds#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%94%20The%20European%20Union,the%20Center%20for%20Global%20Development)) ([Europe To Be Short 44 Million Workers by 2050 Without Increased Immigration, New Study Finds | Center For Global Development](https://www.cgdev.org/article/europe-be-short-44-million-workers-2050-without-increased-immigration-new-study-finds#:~:text=Worker%20gap%20by%202050)). Migrants – when properly integrated – contribute as workers, entrepreneurs, taxpayers. The action plan should thus focus on **integration programs** for those allowed to stay: language and job training, recognition of qualifications, and pathways to citizenship for those who fulfill requirements. By demonstrating that Europe integrates and values its legal migrants, it also builds public support for a more open but controlled immigration system.

**Addressing Root Causes and U.S. Role:** A critical and often uncomfortable aspect is acknowledging how _U.S. foreign policy has contributed to refugee crises_ that end up at Europe’s doors. Washington’s interventions and proxy wars in the Middle East and North Africa – Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria – have indeed been linked with massive displacement of people. According to analysis by the Cato Institute, _“the vast majority of people seeking asylum [in Europe] come from four countries: Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria. What do those countries have in common? They all were targets of America’s regime change wars.”_ ([America's Regime Change Wars Created Europe's Refugee Crisis | Cato Institute](https://www.cato.org/commentary/americas-regime-change-wars-created-europes-refugee-crisis#:~:text=However%2C%20U,They%20all%20were%20targets%20of)). For example, over 6.8 million Syrians have been displaced by the civil war since 2011 ([America's Regime Change Wars Created Europe's Refugee Crisis | Cato Institute](https://www.cato.org/commentary/americas-regime-change-wars-created-europes-refugee-crisis#:~:text=Still%20another%20appalling%20refugee%20crisis,8%20million%20are)), a conflict inflamed by a U.S.-backed effort to unseat Assad ([America's Regime Change Wars Created Europe's Refugee Crisis | Cato Institute](https://www.cato.org/commentary/americas-regime-change-wars-created-europes-refugee-crisis#:~:text=match%20at%20L191%20refugees,Assad)). The chaos in Libya after NATO’s 2011 intervention (led by Europe but strongly pushed by the U.S.) turned that country into a major departure point for migrants across the Mediterranean. The long war in Afghanistan (2001–2021) created millions of refugees; when the U.S. withdrew, Europe feared a new influx. European leaders can no longer shy away from these links. As one commentary put it bluntly, _“Washington’s armed interventions…have produced monumental headaches for European allies” in the form of steady refugee flows ([America's Regime Change Wars Created Europe's Refugee Crisis | Cato Institute](https://www.cato.org/commentary/americas-regime-change-wars-created-europes-refugee-crisis#:~:text=America%E2%80%99s%20Regime%20Change%20Wars%20Created,Europe%E2%80%99s%20Refugee%20Crisis)) ([America's Regime Change Wars Created Europe's Refugee Crisis | Cato Institute](https://www.cato.org/commentary/americas-regime-change-wars-created-europes-refugee-crisis#:~:text=match%20at%20L195%20inflicted%2C%20the,afforded%20them%20has%20varied%20greatly))._ This doesn’t assign sole blame to the U.S. – local regimes, other regional actors, and European countries themselves (some joined the interventions) share responsibility. But recognizing this history is key to shaping a different approach.

Europe should **pivot its foreign policy to prevent and resolve conflicts, rather than following destabilizing regime-change agendas.** This means being more cautious about military interventions and instead investing in diplomacy and development in neighboring regions. It also means using its influence to encourage the U.S. to consider the migratory fallout of its actions. For instance, Europe can insist on being involved in any post-conflict planning (to stabilize countries) whenever U.S. actions might create refugee flows. A more independent Europe could even dissent from U.S. strategies it finds harmful – e.g., if a future U.S. administration were to pursue a hardline policy that risks a new war (say with Iran), Europe could actively mediate to avoid war and displacement. By pursuing its own line – one that prioritizes stability in Africa and the Middle East – Europe not only does the right thing morally but also reduces refugee pressure long term.

In the short term, Europe needs to help alleviate current crises: increasing humanitarian aid to regions hosting refugees (Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, etc. for Syrians; Pakistan/Iran for Afghans; African states for regional conflicts) so fewer feel compelled to journey onwards. Europe can also provide legal pathways (like humanitarian visas) to discourage dangerous illegal crossings, focusing on the most vulnerable cases and thereby undercutting smuggling networks.

**Strengthening Border Security and Managing Leverage:** Europe’s external borders must be better secured to regain control of migration flows. This doesn’t mean “Fortress Europe” in a literal sense, but it does require modern surveillance, more personnel (like the expansion of Frontex, the EU border agency), and agreements with transit countries. A major factor has been _Turkey’s role in controlling migrant flows into Europe_, particularly since the 2015 crisis. Turkey hosts about 3.6 million Syrian refugees and has used the threat of “opening the gates” to Europe as a bargaining chip ([Turkey's Erdogan Threatens To Let Refugees Into Europe If More Aid Not Given](https://www.rferl.org/a/turkey-erdogan-threatens-to-let-refugees-into-europe-if-more-aid-not-given/30258718.html#:~:text=Turkish%20President%20Recep%20Tayyip%20Erdogan,provide%20additional%20support%20for%20them)) ([Turkey's Erdogan Threatens To Let Refugees Into Europe If More Aid Not Given](https://www.rferl.org/a/turkey-erdogan-threatens-to-let-refugees-into-europe-if-more-aid-not-given/30258718.html#:~:text=Under%20a%202016%20readmission%20agreement,EU%20that%20came%20from%20Turkey)). President Erdoğan explicitly warned that he could unleash “millions” of migrants to Europe if the EU didn’t support Turkey adequately or if he wanted to pressure Brussels ([Turkey's Erdogan Threatens To Let Refugees Into Europe If More Aid Not Given](https://www.rferl.org/a/turkey-erdogan-threatens-to-let-refugees-into-europe-if-more-aid-not-given/30258718.html#:~:text=Turkish%20President%20Recep%20Tayyip%20Erdogan,file%20photo)). In 2019, he repeated his threat to _“open the gates”_ unless more aid was provided ([Turkey's Erdogan Threatens To Let Refugees Into Europe If More Aid Not Given](https://www.rferl.org/a/turkey-erdogan-threatens-to-let-refugees-into-europe-if-more-aid-not-given/30258718.html#:~:text=Turkish%20President%20Recep%20Tayyip%20Erdogan,provide%20additional%20support%20for%20them)). And in early 2020, Turkey did facilitate migrants moving toward Greece as a form of leverage. This tactic – essentially _using migration as a geopolitical weapon_ – underscores Europe’s vulnerability.

To counter this, Europe should both **fortify its borders and reduce its dependency on Turkey’s goodwill.** The EU-Turkey migration deal of 2016 (where Turkey restrains departures in exchange for €6 billion and political concessions) bought time, but it left Europe somewhat at Turkey’s mercy. A more sustainable strategy is twofold: (1) **Improve border defenses and processing** – invest in barriers and sensors at key land entry points (e.g., the Greek-Turkish land border), deploy more patrol vessels in the Aegean and Mediterranean to manage sea arrivals, and establish EU-run reception centers that can quickly handle asylum claims (distinguishing refugees from migrants seeking work). The EU’s new Pact on Migration and Asylum aims to streamline this and share responsibility among member states ([The EU Pact on Migration and Asylum: context, challenges and ...](https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/analyses/the-eu-pact-on-migration-and-asylum-context-challenges-and-limitations/#:~:text=,States%27%20management%20of%20irregular%20arrivals)). (2) **Diversify partnerships** – work with North African states like Tunisia, Egypt, and Morocco to intercept and manage migration from their shores, not just rely on Turkey. Also, press the UK (though it’s outside Schengen) to coordinate on preventing irregular crossings (like the English Channel issue). By closing loopholes on all fronts, Europe reduces the impact of any single country’s leverage.

However, Europe should also attempt to **reset relations with Turkey** via positive engagement. A Turkey that sees benefits in cooperation (beyond just money – perhaps visa liberalization for Turks, or updating the customs union) may be less inclined to weaponize migrants. Nonetheless, Europe must be prepared that if Turkey (or any state) tries blackmail, it can weather the storm. This means having emergency plans to seal borders and mobilize resources. Right now, any mention by Erdoğan causes alarm in European capitals – that imbalance needs correction.

**Balancing Security with Humanity:** Europe’s approach must not lose sight of humanitarian obligations. The right to asylum for those fleeing war and persecution is enshrined in international law and European values. Even as Europe tightens control, it should maintain **legal resettlement programs** so that refugees don’t have to arrive illegally. For example, increasing the UNHCR resettlement of refugees directly from camps in conflict regions to EU countries – this both saves lives and undercuts smugglers. Europe can also use skilled migration programs to _invite the workers it needs_ (such as IT professionals, engineers, healthcare workers from abroad) through legal channels, making irregular migration less attractive. Germany, for one, is reforming its immigration law to attract skilled workers, acknowledging labor shortages. These legal pathways create a win-win: they fulfill Europe’s economic needs and reduce chaotic influxes.

Finally, integration and internal security should go hand in hand. Europe must ensure that immigrant communities are not marginalized (which can lead to crime or radicalization). Education, employment, and community outreach are critical. When migrants see a future in Europe, they are more likely to embrace and contribute to their new home.

**Recommended Actions (Migration):** (1) **Fast-track a common EU Asylum System:** fully implement the new Migration Pact by 2025 – establish EU “hotspot” processing centers at key entry points with teams of interpreters, judges, and security officers so decisions on entry or return are made within weeks, not months. Those denied asylum should be swiftly returned under new return agreements ([EU to propose new migration rules in latest rightward shift – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-migration-propose-rules-right-wing/#:~:text=The%20European%20Commission%20is%20set,to%20three%20European%20Union%20diplomats)) ([EU to propose new migration rules in latest rightward shift – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-migration-propose-rules-right-wing/#:~:text=A%20few%20principles%20are%20likely,a%20significant%20amount%20of%20time)). (2) **Conclude readmission deals** with major origin countries (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Nigeria, Pakistan, Bangladesh, etc.) – possibly linking EU visa quotas or development aid to cooperation on returns. Aim to boost the effective return rate (currently often below 40%) to above 70%. (3) **Scale up Frontex** to at least 10,000 operational border guards (from ~5,000 now) and equip them with modern surveillance drones and maritime assets by 2027. Ensure every external land border section has monitoring and rapid reaction force availability. (4) **Turkey strategy:** renew the EU-Turkey migration deal with modifications: continue financial support for refugees in Turkey through 2028 (~€1 billion/year) but also invest in improving conditions in northern Syria so some refugees can eventually return safely. Simultaneously, finalize plans for a border fence on the Greek-Turkish frontier and have contingency for naval blockade if Turkey fully reneges. Basically, appreciate Turkey’s help but don’t bank on it exclusively. (5) **Humanitarian and skilled pathways:** annually resettle a quota of refugees (e.g. 50,000 across EU) directly from crisis regions, focusing on families and vulnerable groups. Expand the Blue Card program for skilled workers and harmonize it – target bringing in 250,000 high-skill immigrants per year to the EU in sectors facing shortages. (6) **Integration investment:** allocate funds (perhaps €5 billion EU-wide over five years) to cities and towns for language courses, housing, and job placement for recognized refugees and legal migrants. This prevents ghettos and showcases the positive side of immigration.

By executing this multi-layered plan, Europe will regain control over its borders and migrant flows (a prerequisite for public consent to any immigration), while still upholding its humanitarian ideals and tapping the benefits of migration. The narrative can then shift: Europe is neither helpless in the face of mass migration nor heartless toward those in need – it is competent, in charge, and principled.

## 6. Diplomatic & Global Positioning

**Equal Partnerships in Africa:** Europe’s historical relationship with Africa is marred by colonialism and paternalism. In a multipolar world where African nations have alternatives (China, Russia, others), Europe must fundamentally reset its approach to one of **equal partnership and mutual benefit**. This means shedding the remnants of “Francafrique” or other neo-colonial influences and treating African countries as sovereign partners with agency. European powers can no longer rely on old influence; instead, they should offer what African nations genuinely seek: investment, fair trade, technology transfer, and respect for local priorities. President Macron has explicitly acknowledged the need for a new relationship, stating that Africa is not a zone of influence but a partner, and Europe must “build a new balanced partnership” with the continent.

In practical terms, _Europe can establish partnerships focusing on development, infrastructure, and education_ – areas where Europe’s expertise aligns with Africa’s needs. The EU’s “Global Gateway” initiative, which pledges €300 billion for infrastructure worldwide by 2027, devotes a large portion to Africa for green energy, transport links, and digital projects. This can be Europe’s answer to China’s Belt and Road, but it must be implemented efficiently and visibly. Working _with_ African institutions like the African Union (AU) is crucial. For instance, rather than imposing projects, the EU should co-create them with the AU’s development agenda (Agenda 2063).

One key sphere is **trade and industrialization**. Europe should facilitate more value addition in Africa (so African countries aren’t just exporting raw commodities). The EU can offer more generous market access beyond current Economic Partnership Agreements – perhaps quota-free access for processed goods, encouraging African manufacturing. There’s also scope for **joint ventures**: e.g., European firms building vaccine production facilities in Africa (a lesson from COVID vaccine inequity), or partnering in mineral extraction in a way that benefits local economies (processing minerals in Africa rather than just shipping ores to Europe). Additionally, Europe can support African peace and security efforts by funding AU peacekeeping and training programs, without trying to dominate them.

Crucially, Europe must project a message of **respect and humility** in Africa. High-profile gestures, like returning looted cultural artifacts from colonial times and acknowledging historical wrongs, can go a long way to build goodwill (some such returns have started). Diplomatically, European leaders should engage with the full spectrum of African leadership, not just a few traditional allies, and listen more than lecture.

The outcome Europe wants is a stable Africa that sees Europe as a preferred partner – this helps reduce conflicts (and thus migration and terrorism) and opens opportunities for both. It also bluntens Chinese and Russian influence. As evidence, when China’s loans have led to debt issues or Russia’s Wagner Group causes instability, Africans often still turn to Europe for balanced support – Europe should be there with open arms and fair terms, not heavy-handed conditionalities that feed resentment.

**Alliances with Mexico and Canada:** _In response to U.S. pressure, Europe can seek closer ties with America’s neighbors_ – Mexico and Canada – which at times have found themselves at odds with Washington’s policies. Under the Trump administration, both Canada and Mexico faced U.S. tariffs (steel, aluminum) and aggressive renegotiation of NAFTA. Europe stepped in to strengthen relations: the EU quickly updated its free trade agreement with Mexico (agreement in principle in 2018, awaiting ratification) and provisionally applied the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with Canada since 2017. These trade links lay a foundation for strategic cooperation.

If U.S. policy becomes more protectionist or bullying, Canada and Mexico may indeed look to diversify their partnerships. Canada, a close U.S. ally, nevertheless has shown an independent streak when pressed – for example, matching U.S. tariffs with counter-tariffs during disputes ([The Canada-EU Leaders' Meeting: A New Era of Cooperation? | Wilson Center](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/canada-eu-leaders-meeting-new-era-cooperation#:~:text=,Institute)) ([The Canada-EU Leaders' Meeting: A New Era of Cooperation? | Wilson Center](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/canada-eu-leaders-meeting-new-era-cooperation#:~:text=economic%20alliances%20and%20push%20back,against%20US%20protectionism)). The EU and Canada in a 2025 summit presented themselves as “good allies and trusted friends” who will stand together to “limit the impact of US economic policies” and diversify trade ([The Canada-EU Leaders' Meeting: A New Era of Cooperation? | Wilson Center](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/canada-eu-leaders-meeting-new-era-cooperation#:~:text=Amid%20the%20tensions%20and%20threats,trade%20negotiations%2C%20and%20promote%20multilateralism)). This highlights that Canada and Europe are coordinating to resist U.S. protectionism. Europe should institutionalize this: perhaps through a **EU-Canada strategic alliance** that covers not just trade but also coordination on sanctions, technology standards, and even defense (Canada could cooperate with EU defense missions despite NATO overlap).

With Mexico, an interesting angle is that Mexico is a major trading partner of the U.S. but also an emerging manufacturing hub that could serve Europe. If the U.S. tries to pressure Europe economically, the EU and Mexico might expand trade to reduce reliance on the U.S. market. The modernized EU-Mexico trade deal (once ratified) will eliminate virtually all tariffs. Europe can support Mexico’s development of high-tech manufacturing (like EVs or electronics) by European investment, providing an alternative to U.S. or Chinese capital. Politically, Mexico often takes more non-aligned stances – for instance, it did not join Western sanctions on Russia. While Europe might prefer alignment on such issues, it can at least engage Mexico in dialogue and find common ground (like drug trafficking combat, climate initiatives, etc.).

In essence, _by allying with Canada and Mexico_, Europe gains partners in the Americas who can amplify its voice and share intelligence on U.S. moves. It also sends a signal to Washington that Europe has other friends in “America’s backyard,” enhancing Europe’s bargaining position. Concretely, Europe, Canada, and Mexico (who are already linked via various forums like G20, OECD) could form a trilateral consultation mechanism on trade emergencies – if the U.S. imposes a harmful tariff, they coordinate responses or even joint retaliation. During Trump’s tariff war, the EU literally “joined Canada and Mexico to strike back at the U.S.” with retaliatory tariffs ([EU Joins Canada and Mexico to Strike Back at the US - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8wvaB_wiKY#:~:text=EU%20Joins%20Canada%20and%20Mexico,Treasury%20Secretary%20Scott)) ([With its U.S. alliance under pressure, could Canada join the EU?](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ig2x5g/with_its_us_alliance_under_pressure_could_canada/#:~:text=With%20its%20U,may%20be%20a%20strengthened)). A formal mechanism could streamline this in the future. Additionally, on global issues like climate change, having Canada and Mexico on Europe’s side adds weight in negotiations vis-à-vis a recalcitrant U.S.

**Normalizing Relations with Russia (Long-Term):** While Russia under Putin is an adversary due to its invasion of Ukraine, Europe should keep an eye on the future: _How might Europe align with a post-conflict or post-Putin Russia under normalized terms?_ Historically, a stable partnership with Russia was seen as the “grand prize” for European security – integrating Russia into a common security framework would end the East-West divide in Europe. Macron and other leaders have at times floated visions of a new security architecture including Russia, provided Moscow’s concerns are addressed and it abides by international law ([Macron says new security architecture should give guarantees for Russia | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/macron-says-new-security-architecture-should-give-guarantees-russia-2022-12-03/#:~:text=PARIS%2C%20Dec%203%20%28Reuters%29%20,in%20remarks%20broadcast%20on%20Saturday)) ([Macron says new security architecture should give guarantees for Russia | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/macron-says-new-security-architecture-should-give-guarantees-russia-2022-12-03/#:~:text=,Macron%20said)). Macron argued that Europe needs to prepare to offer Russia **security guarantees** in a future peace deal, addressing Russian fears about NATO expansion (missiles on its borders) in exchange for a stable peace ([Macron says new security architecture should give guarantees for Russia | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/macron-says-new-security-architecture-should-give-guarantees-russia-2022-12-03/#:~:text=In%20an%20interview%20with%20French,prepare%20its%20future%20security%20architecture)). This doesn’t mean conceding to Russian aggression, but recognizing that any lasting settlement will involve compromise on both sides.

If (and it’s a big if) Russia ends its aggressive posture – for instance, via a peace agreement in Ukraine that is acceptable to Kyiv – Europe could gradually remove sanctions and resume economic ties. The potential alignment could involve: Russia rejoining forums like the Council of Europe, negotiating new arms control agreements with Europeans (not just with the U.S. as before), and collaborating on areas of common interest (counter-terrorism, climate in the Arctic, space exploration). For example, a cooperative effort to develop the Arctic (which is becoming more accessible due to climate change) could be mutually beneficial – Russia has resources and needs investment, Europe has technology and interest in stable supply of raw materials.

Europe must be clear-eyed: trust in the current Russian government is nearly zero. But thinking 10–15 years ahead, one can envision a different Russian leadership seeking to rebuild ties with Europe to balance an overbearing China or to modernize its economy. Europe should not permanently alienate Russia if it can be peacefully integrated. As the famous idea goes, the “common European home” from Lisbon to Vladivostok is incomplete without Russia. Aligning with Russia in the long term – under normalized, democratic conditions – would give Europe strategic depth and resource security (Russian energy and minerals) and remove a major security threat. It would also diminish U.S. influence because Europe’s security would no longer depend on NATO against Russia. Of course, any such normalization must be contingent on Russian behavior: withdrawal from occupied territories, respect for neighbors, and acceptance of rules-based order.

In the meantime, Europe can keep channels open with segments of Russian society (cultural, academic exchanges with those not sanctioned) to lay groundwork for future reconciliation. It can also coordinate with countries like India or Israel who maintain dialogue with Moscow, to possibly facilitate future negotiations.

**Securing Greenland and the Arctic:** _Greenland_ – an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark – has outsized strategic importance due to its location and resources. The Arctic’s melting ice is unlocking sea routes and vast mineral wealth (rare earths, uranium, hydrocarbons). Both the U.S. and China have shown heightened interest: famously, President Trump mused about buying Greenland in 2019, startling Europeans and prompting Danish rejection. This incident **“confirmed…that the Arctic Island is a critical geopolitical issue for the United States – and that it should also be the same for the European Union.” ([Greenland: a geostrategic challenge for the European Union
in the age of Trump 2.0](https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/european-issues/778-greenland-a-geostrategic-challenge-for-the-european-union-in-the-age-of-trump-2-0#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%27s%20return%20to%20the,in%20a%20clearly%20strategic%20way))**. Europe cannot be complacent; it must actively protect its interests in Greenland to prevent either American unilateralism or Chinese encroachment. The EU has, in the past, neglected Greenland’s importance ([Greenland: a geostrategic challenge for the European Union
in the age of Trump 2.0](https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/european-issues/778-greenland-a-geostrategic-challenge-for-the-european-union-in-the-age-of-trump-2-0#:~:text=The%20question%20of%20the%20future,the%20geostrategic%20importance%20of%20Greenland)), but that is changing now.

Greenland’s populace of ~56,000 has local self-rule and is edging towards possibly seeking independence from Denmark in the future. If that happens, it’s crucial Greenland remains aligned with Europe, not falling into another’s sphere. Already, Chinese companies have attempted to invest in Greenland’s rare earth mines and infrastructure; some projects were blocked after security concerns. The U.S. maintains the Thule Air Base in Greenland as part of North American defense. Europe should coordinate closely with Denmark (and the U.S. as NATO ally) to ensure a unified approach: keeping Greenland’s development closely tied to the West.

One idea is for the EU to forge a special partnership with Greenland – even though it’s not an independent state, the EU can engage with its government on issues like climate research, mining regulation, and education. The EU has funded some programmes in Greenland and could expand this, perhaps by opening an EU office in Nuuk. _Protecting Greenland_ also means being present: supporting Denmark’s military monitoring in the Arctic, perhaps an EU Arctic Observation Mission that includes Greenlandic waters and airspace. Ensuring sustainable development is also key – Europe can help Greenland develop mining projects in an environmentally responsible way that benefits local Greenlanders (training, jobs) so they are less tempted by Chinese offers.

Given Trump’s interest, Europe should be prepared for the U.S. to continue pressing influence (the U.S. reopened a consulate in Nuuk in 2020). The ideal scenario is a cooperative one where Europe, the U.S., and Greenland’s authorities work together – for example, jointly financing airports or ports in Greenland so that no one country dominates. Europe’s stake is to guarantee _access to Greenland’s rare earth elements_, which are vital for high-tech and green industries, so that it’s not beholden to China (currently China controls much of global rare earth supply). Partnering on a rare earth mining venture in Greenland with European companies would secure a strategic supply and bolster Greenland’s economy, a win-win.

Additionally, Europe should support **Arctic governance** frameworks. The EU has been trying to get observer status in the Arctic Council (it’s been blocked largely due to disputes with Russia in past, but maybe more welcome if Russia remains suspended from the Council as it is since 2022). Active involvement in Arctic science and search-and-rescue will increase Europe’s clout in shaping Arctic rules (like shipping lane regulations, fishing moratoria). Greenland figures in these as a huge chunk of the Arctic.

**Aligning with BRICS – Opportunities and Risks:** The BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, now expanding to include others) is positioning itself as a champion of the Global South and an alternative to Western-dominated institutions. Europe is not part of BRICS and often sees it as a challenge to the Western-led order that Europe helped build. However, Europe could find common cause with some aims of BRICS and potentially engage with it to further European interests. For instance, both Europe and BRICS members like India and Brazil favor a more multipolar system where no single superpower (including the U.S.) can dictate terms. Europe’s advocacy for multilateralism might resonate with BRICS’ calls for reforms in global governance to give developing countries more voice ([Why the BRICS Summit in Kazan should be a Wake-up Call for the EU - Egmont Institute](https://www.egmontinstitute.be/why-the-brics-summit-in-kazan-should-be-a-wake-up-call-for-the-eu/#:~:text=This%20policy%20brief%20examines%20the,alignment%E2%80%99%20to%20diversify)) ([Why the BRICS Summit in Kazan should be a Wake-up Call for the EU - Egmont Institute](https://www.egmontinstitute.be/why-the-brics-summit-in-kazan-should-be-a-wake-up-call-for-the-eu/#:~:text=to%20include%20Ethiopia%2C%20Egypt%2C%20the,effort%20is%20essential%20despite%20the)).

One concrete area is **global financial reform**: BRICS countries have set up the New Development Bank and talk about de-dollarization. Europe, while not seeking to undermine the dollar outright, does have an interest in a more diversified international monetary system (so it’s less exposed to U.S. sanctions or economic policy swings). The euro is a natural candidate to play a larger role. Europe could cooperate with BRICS in promoting the use of multiple currencies in trade – for example, trading with Brazil in euros or reals rather than dollars. If Europe were to align partially with BRICS on such issues, it could drive a wedge in Western unity, so caution is needed. But subtle support for a fairer financial system (like backing a bigger role for IMF Special Drawing Rights, something BRICS often ask for) could earn goodwill.

Diplomatically, Europe should maintain dialogue with BRICS as a grouping. Even if Russia and China have adversarial stances, India, Brazil, and South Africa are important democracies that Europe can work with. If BRICS collectively take positions (e.g. on internet governance or UN reform), Europe could sometimes lend support where it aligns, rather than reflexively opposing because the U.S. does. This would signal European independence in foreign policy.

However, _fully “aligning” with BRICS would severely strain Europe’s alliance with the U.S._ and is not advisable unless the transatlantic relationship utterly breaks down. Europe’s interest is to be a bridge and independent center, not to flip wholesale into another camp. So the calibration should be: engage BRICS on specific issues (climate finance, global health, WTO reform) to show Europe listens to the Global South, but avoid being co-opted into any anti-Western bloc. Europe can also use its ties with BRICS members to play mediator – e.g., during the Ukraine war, India and Brazil have tried to mediate; Europe can coordinate with them to explore any peace initiatives, which might complement or sometimes offer alternatives to U.S. approaches.

If Europe cozies too much to BRICS, Washington will view it as undermining the Western front. Thus, Europe should communicate clearly to the U.S. that engaging BRICS is about stability and inclusion, not a betrayal. Ideally, Europe can convince the U.S. to also take a more cooperative approach to emerging powers, but if not, Europe must sometimes go its own way. The long-term benefit is that Europe would be seen by the developing world as a more neutral and friendly power, not just part of an American bloc. This increases Europe’s global influence as countries in Africa, Latin America, and Asia rise in importance.

**Recommended Actions (Diplomacy & Alliances):** (1) **Africa-Europe Alliance:** Organize annual EU-AU summits with concrete projects – by 2025 launch a €20 billion _Africa-Europe Investment Package_ focusing on renewable energy (like solar farms in the Sahel feeding both African and European grids) and transport corridors (modern railways connecting African markets). Ensure African firms and workers are involved to build local capacity. Also, double the Erasmus Mundus scholarships for African students to study in Europe, forging people-to-people bonds. (2) **Canada & Mexico:** Upgrade the EU-Canada Strategic Partnership to a treaty-level alliance by 2026, covering coordination on Indo-Pacific strategy (both are Pacific nations) and a mutual support clause if facing economic coercion by third parties (similar to how NATO covers military). With Mexico, expedite ratification of the updated EU-Mexico FTA and initiate a _EU-Mexico security dialogue_ (addressing organized crime, cyber threats, etc.). Consider including Mexico in certain EU diplomatic initiatives as an observer, showing respect to its perspective. (3) **Greenland & Arctic:** The EU should establish a formal cooperation agreement with Greenland by 2025, including funding of at least €1.5 billion over 10 years for infrastructure (airports, broadband, harbors) ([Greenland: a geostrategic challenge for the European Union
in the age of Trump 2.0](https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/european-issues/778-greenland-a-geostrategic-challenge-for-the-european-union-in-the-age-of-trump-2-0#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%27s%20return%20to%20the,in%20a%20clearly%20strategic%20way)). In return, secure preferential access to Greenland’s critical minerals for European companies. Support Denmark in stationing an Arctic security hub in Greenland (maybe an EU Arctic Research and Coast Guard Center) to increase European presence. Keep close consultation with the U.S., making sure this complements NATO’s Arctic security. (4) **Russia outlook:** Develop a _European post-war plan for Eastern Europe_ that includes a framework to gradually reintegrate a reformed Russia: e.g., outline conditions for lifting sanctions and potential Russia-EU trade restoration if Russia meets certain benchmarks (troop withdrawals, UN-supervised referendums, etc.). Present this not as appeasement but as giving Russia a diplomatic off-ramp. Meanwhile, continue supporting Ukraine robustly so that any eventual negotiations happen from a position of strength. (5) **BRICS Engagement:** Seek observer status or special guest invitations for the EU in BRICS summits on topics of global governance. Propose an _EU-BRICS Forum_ on Sustainable Development to collaborate on SDGs (could neutralize ideological divides). In global financial talks, cautiously support creation of alternatives like a BRICS payment system as long as it’s compatible with EU systems, to signal openness. Importantly, maintain transatlantic dialogue to explain Europe’s positions – perhaps a trilateral (EU-US-Global South) format could be initiated to address developing country issues so it’s not just BRICS vs G7.

By diversifying its diplomatic partnerships, Europe will not be isolated if U.S. relations sour – it will have friends worldwide. And by showing leadership in regions like Africa and the Arctic, Europe enhances its profile as a global power in its own right, one that is cooperative rather than coercive. This diplomatic autonomy solidifies Europe’s place in a multipolar order as the “third pillar” alongside America and China – or better yet, as a balancing force among many.

## 7. Trade & Economic Independence

**Countering U.S. Tariffs and Economic Pressure:** In recent years, Europe has experienced the unpredictable nature of U.S. trade policy – from steel and aluminum tariffs under Trump to extraterritorial sanctions affecting European companies. As a sovereign power, Europe needs an _economic strategy that can withstand U.S. pressure or protectionism_. This involves both defensive measures and proactive diversification.

Defensively, the EU has already sharpened its trade arsenal. After Trump’s shocks, the EU “strengthened its trade defense arsenal” by updating regulations and creating new tools ([The EU's strategy to counter Trump's tariffs: An iron fist in a velvet ...](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-strategy-donald-trump-tariffs-trade/#:~:text=The%20EU%27s%20strategy%20to%20counter,first%20by%20revamping%20its)). For instance, the EU now has a law on countering economic coercion, enabling it to respond to measures like unjustified tariffs or boycotts. Europe should be prepared to **retaliate in a calibrated way** if the U.S. imposes tariffs targeting Europe. During the 2018 tariff episode, the EU responded in kind (tariffs on American bourbon, motorcycles, etc.), which helped lead to negotiations. The _ECFR suggests Europe must be willing to “convincingly threaten retaliation on US businesses if tariffs are imposed”_ ([Facing Trump’s tariff war: A defensive blueprint for the EU | ECFR](https://ecfr.eu/article/facing-trumps-tariff-war-a-defensive-blueprint-for-the-eu/#:~:text=Juggling%20these%20demands%2C%20while%20maintaining,businesses%20if%20tariffs%20are%20imposed)) ([Facing Trump’s tariff war: A defensive blueprint for the EU | ECFR](https://ecfr.eu/article/facing-trumps-tariff-war-a-defensive-blueprint-for-the-eu/#:~:text=protect%20its%20interests%20by%20appeasing,businesses%20if%20tariffs%20are%20imposed)). That means identifying key U.S. exports or companies that would pressure Washington politically if targeted (for example, tariffs on goods from swing-state industries). The EU’s unity is crucial here – divide-and-rule tactics by offering different terms to individual EU states must be resisted with a common front.

At the same time, Europe can try to _appease or negotiate_ to avoid trade war. As analysis notes, the EU could offer cooperation in areas the U.S. cares about (like aligning on some China tech restrictions) as leverage to dissuade U.S. tariffs on the EU ([Facing Trump’s tariff war: A defensive blueprint for the EU | ECFR](https://ecfr.eu/article/facing-trumps-tariff-war-a-defensive-blueprint-for-the-eu/#:~:text=Greer%E2%80%99s%20call%20for%20the%20EU,win%20Europeans%20can%20offer%20him)) ([Facing Trump’s tariff war: A defensive blueprint for the EU | ECFR](https://ecfr.eu/article/facing-trumps-tariff-war-a-defensive-blueprint-for-the-eu/#:~:text=EU%20will%20need%20to%20convincingly,businesses%20if%20tariffs%20are%20imposed)). Indeed, Europe prepared a “welcome package” for the Trump administration combining “China-related carrots” with warnings of retaliation ([Facing Trump’s tariff war: A defensive blueprint for the EU | ECFR](https://ecfr.eu/article/facing-trumps-tariff-war-a-defensive-blueprint-for-the-eu/#:~:text=EU%20will%20need%20to%20convincingly,businesses%20if%20tariffs%20are%20imposed)). Such tactical linkage should continue: if a future U.S. government demands Europe decouple more from China, Europe could say: “We’ll coordinate export controls if you refrain from tariffing our cars.” Essentially, Europe can trade cooperation for exemption from U.S. trade aggression. However, this should not mean caving on every issue; it’s a balance of firmness and pragmatic compromise.

Offensively, Europe needs to _diversify its trade relationships so it’s less vulnerable to any one partner_. The EU should finalize and implement free trade agreements (FTAs) with other major economies: deals with Mercosur (South America) and India are in negotiation and should be concluded, and existing deals with Japan, Canada, Vietnam, etc., should be nurtured. By expanding trade with Latin America, Asia, and Africa, Europe reduces the share of trade with the U.S., thereby reducing exposure. If the U.S. market accounts for a smaller portion of Europe’s exports (currently around 18% of EU goods exports), U.S. tariffs would hurt less. Additionally, Europe can encourage internal demand and intra-EU trade (which is already large) for stability.

One interesting concept is _strategic decoupling in reverse_: if the U.S. were to sanction European firms (as it threatened with Nord Stream 2, for example), Europe might need to protect those firms or find alternative markets for them. This again highlights the importance of the euro – if European companies can transact in euros and rely less on dollar systems, they are less subject to U.S. financial sanctions. The EU considered in the past a “special purpose vehicle” (INSTEX) to bypass U.S. sanctions on Iran, albeit with limited success. Strengthening such mechanisms for future use is part of economic independence.

**European Self-Sufficiency in Key Sectors:** The pandemic and war disruptions taught Europe about critical sectors where self-sufficiency (or at least reliable supply chains) is essential. These include _medical supplies and pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, energy, food, and defense._ Europe should strive for a degree of self-reliance in each:

- **Medical/Pharma:** Europe was initially caught off guard on PPE and later vaccines. Now it’s investing in onshore vaccine production (EU’s HERA agency) and stockpiling medical gear. By 2030, Europe should produce a significant share of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) domestically or with trusted partners (India is currently a big supplier – diversifying to Eastern Europe or within EU would help). This ensures in a crisis, Europe isn’t in queues behind others.

- **Semiconductors:** Already discussed in tech sovereignty, but to reiterate – chips are the backbone of modern economies and defense. Europe’s push to double its market share with the Chips Act ([Chipmaker CEO says Washington’s anti-China tech blockade is a bad idea – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-tech-sovereignty-china-peter-wennink-asml/#:~:text=The%20EU%2C%20which%20wants%20to,computing%20and%20other%20advanced%20technologies)) is aiming at self-sufficiency in advanced nodes (2-5 nm) and legacy chips (for cars, etc.). If those fabs get built in Germany, France, etc., Europe will not be beholden to Asian supply disruptions or U.S. export whims.

- **Energy:** We covered independence via renewables. It’s worth adding that even within energy, diversifying types is a form of self-sufficiency – having nuclear, renewables, some domestic gas, etc., as a mix. Energy storage (battery, hydrogen) is crucial for renewables; Europe should control that tech to avoid reliance on imported batteries (mostly from China currently).

- **Food:** Europe is largely self-sufficient in food (it’s a net agricultural exporter thanks to the Common Agricultural Policy). But issues like fertilizers (natural gas-based) came up with gas shortages. Investing in green fertilizers (using renewables to create ammonia) can keep European agriculture resilient. Also, climate-proofing European farming ensures independence as global climate could hit food supply.

- **Defense:** Through the military rebuild we discussed, ensuring capacity to produce one’s own weapons is self-sufficiency in defense. The goal: Europe can fight a conflict without needing urgent resupply from abroad. That includes ammo stockpiles and manufacturing that can surge output.

Financially, self-sufficiency means also _insulating from global financial shocks_. The Eurozone’s banking union and capital markets union efforts need to continue to make Europe’s financial system robust on its own. If the U.S. Fed hikes rates or an American financial crisis occurs, Europe should be able to cushion itself – which it can if it deepens its financial integration and uses its own monetary policy effectively. The European Stability Mechanism and EU’s new budgetary tools (like the NextGenerationEU fund) give it more independent macro-economic levers. The EU could consider making some crisis measures permanent, e.g., a permanent fiscal capacity for the Eurozone to stabilize economies in downturns (reducing reliance on U.S.-centric institutions like IMF for help).

**Positioning for a Post-U.S.-Dominant World:** Many predict that the U.S. share of the global economy and its singular dominance will gradually decline as Asia rises and a truly multipolar world economy emerges. Europe should anticipate this _“long-term impact of U.S. global economic decline”_ and position itself to benefit. One aspect is the **internationalization of the euro**: if trust in the U.S. dollar wanes (due to high U.S. debt or political dysfunction over time), countries might seek alternatives for reserves and trade. The euro is the second-most used currency but far behind the dollar. Europe could actively promote the euro in global use – for instance, by invoicing energy imports in euros (already some shift with Russian gas being paid in rubles/euros arrangement and more LNG contracts possibly in euros) and encouraging its use in Africa and Eastern Europe. A stronger global euro would reduce currency risk for Europe and give it more influence (similar to how the dollar gives the U.S. leverage).

Additionally, if the U.S. influence dips, global institutions may reform. Europe should be at the forefront of that reform to ensure it doesn’t just become China’s world. For instance, if IMF quotas are reallocated, Europe might accept a slightly smaller share to accommodate China/India but in exchange could push a European to head the IMF or secure policy priorities. Similarly, with WTO at an impasse partly due to U.S. blocking, Europe can lead in reviving or redesigning the multilateral trade system, potentially forming alliances with other trading nations willing to advance without the U.S. if necessary.

Europe can also **fill vacuums left by U.S. retreat**. If the U.S. becomes less engaged globally (as seen briefly under “America First”), Europe can step up in regions like the Middle East or Africa as a diplomatic broker and investor. For example, the U.S. pivot from the Middle East to Asia left some Gulf states looking for other partners – Europe can enhance ties with GCC countries economically (as it has with UAE, Qatar in energy deals), while also maintaining principled stands where the U.S. might not (like criticizing human rights issues, but still engaging). If the U.S. retrenches from international climate leadership (as under Trump), Europe must lead that agenda and rally other powers, as it largely did by keeping the Paris Agreement momentum.

**Tangible Economic Strategy Elements:**

- Europe should aim to **increase intra-EU trade** and consumption to rely less on exports to fickle markets. The EU’s single market is its strength; completing it (in services, digital, energy) can add significant GDP and reduce need for external demand.
- Push for **technological independence** in key value chains as described; that yields economic independence.
- **Monitor and hedge currency dependencies**: for example, maintain a diversified reserve (the ECB holds some Yuan, etc., not just dollars).
- Build alliances in international standard-setting bodies to ensure European standards (often more stringent) become global norms – which then forces others to adopt EU approaches (an indirect way to extend influence economically).

In summary, Europe’s economic strategy is about being nimble and robust: trade with everyone, but be ready to stand alone if needed. By broadening its economic partnerships, boosting its own capacities, and carefully managing the U.S. relationship, Europe can avoid being squeezed in great power competitions and can even _benefit_ from the shifts (like attracting investment from those who want an alternative to China or U.S., etc.).

**Recommended Actions (Trade & Independence):** (1) **Enforce the Anti-Coercion Instrument** immediately when needed – e.g., if the U.S. or China penalizes an EU member economically, trigger proportional countermeasures to deter future coercion. (2) **Complete new FTAs:** Ratify EU-Mercosur by 2024 with added sustainability guarantees, conclude EU-India by 2026, and explore an EU-ASEAN framework for wider access in Southeast Asia. Aim to have FTAs covering 80% of EU trade by 2030 (up from ~30% today). (3) **Promote euro in trade:** By 2030, target a 10% increase in the portion of global foreign exchange reserves in euros (from ~20% to 30%). Use tools like offering euro liquidity swaps to partner central banks, and require EU foreign aid/loans to be euro-denominated. (4) **Support re-shoring and friend-shoring:** Provide incentives (tax breaks, subsidies from the Sovereignty Fund) for critical industries to set up in Europe or in friendly countries (e.g., battery materials from Australia or Canada). The goal is to ensure no more than 50% of supply for essential products comes from any one country outside the EU. (5) **Boost internal demand:** Consider a modest EU-level stimulus when needed (like NextGenEU-like investments in green and digital) to keep growth, so Europe isn’t overly reliant on exports to the U.S. or China for its economy. (6) **Set up a European Monetary Fund** by expanding the ESM’s role to help Eurozone members in crisis without IMF involvement, reducing dependency on U.S.-influenced IMF decisions.

By implementing these actions, Europe will be less vulnerable to trade wars or sanctions, and it will have the agility to respond to global economic power shifts. It will trade with the U.S. as an equal, not as a junior, and with China with reciprocity, not naivety. In a world where no one country dominates, Europe’s large unified market and stable currency can make it a _central pole_ of economic stability – a role that benefits both Europeans and the wider global economy.

## 8. Israel & Foreign Policy Autonomy

**Reevaluating Europe’s Stance on Israel:** Europe’s relationship with Israel is complex. On one hand, many European nations feel a moral commitment to Israel’s security (rooted in the Holocaust and historical ties); on the other hand, Europe champions human rights and a two-state solution, leading to criticism of Israeli policies towards Palestinians. The question arises: _does Europe’s current stance – often aligned closely with the U.S. in supporting Israel – truly serve European interests and credibility?_ In recent conflicts, such as Israel’s war in Gaza in 2023, Europe showed deep divisions. Some governments gave Israel near-unconditional support, while others, along with European publics, were appalled by the humanitarian toll on Palestinians ([‘Our Credibility Is at Stake.’ How Divisions Over Israel’s War in Gaza Undermine the EU - DAWN](https://dawnmena.org/our-credibility-is-at-stake-how-divisions-over-israels-war-in-gaza-undermine-the-eu/#:~:text=The%20European%20Union%20was%20united,according%20to%20Gaza%27s%20health%20authorities)) ([‘Our Credibility Is at Stake.’ How Divisions Over Israel’s War in Gaza Undermine the EU - DAWN](https://dawnmena.org/our-credibility-is-at-stake-how-divisions-over-israels-war-in-gaza-undermine-the-eu/#:~:text=On%20one%20end%20of%20the,fire)). This split undermines Europe’s ability to influence events and also its image abroad. As one European official warned during the Gaza crisis, “our credibility is at stake” ([‘Our Credibility Is at Stake.’ How Divisions Over Israel’s War in Gaza Undermine the EU - DAWN](https://dawnmena.org/our-credibility-is-at-stake-how-divisions-over-israels-war-in-gaza-undermine-the-eu/#:~:text=pushing%20for%20an%20EU%20leaders%27,Our%20credibility%20is%20at%20stake)) when the EU cannot collectively uphold the principles it applies elsewhere (like condemning war crimes) ([‘Our Credibility Is at Stake.’ How Divisions Over Israel’s War in Gaza Undermine the EU - DAWN](https://dawnmena.org/our-credibility-is-at-stake-how-divisions-over-israels-war-in-gaza-undermine-the-eu/#:~:text=the%20European%20Union%20to%20act,Our%20credibility%20is%20at%20stake)).

Europe needs to shape a more _autonomous Middle East policy_ that is consistent and balanced, rather than being seen as towing the U.S.-Israel line regardless of circumstances. **Currently, Europe’s perceived bias toward Israel – or at least its inability to act decisively in favor of Palestinian rights – has hurt its standing in the Global South.** Many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America view Europe’s advocacy of international law as selective: firm on Ukraine, but tepid on Palestine ([‘Our Credibility Is at Stake.’ How Divisions Over Israel’s War in Gaza Undermine the EU - DAWN](https://dawnmena.org/our-credibility-is-at-stake-how-divisions-over-israels-war-in-gaza-undermine-the-eu/#:~:text=,crimes%2C%20exposes%20the%20West%27s%20hypocrisy)). For Europe to be a credible global player, it must align its policies with its values across all regions.

This might mean **taking a tougher stance on Israeli actions that violate international law**, in a calibrated way. For instance, if Israel continues expanding settlements in the West Bank (widely deemed illegal), the EU could enforce its own laws by excluding settlement products from its markets or even sanctioning entities directly involved in settlement construction. Some European parliaments and ministers have broached ideas like this. Belgium’s deputy PM in 2023 called to consider sanctions on Israel over indiscriminate bombing in Gaza ([‘Our Credibility Is at Stake.’ How Divisions Over Israel’s War in Gaza Undermine the EU - DAWN](https://dawnmena.org/our-credibility-is-at-stake-how-divisions-over-israels-war-in-gaza-undermine-the-eu/#:~:text=On%20one%20end%20of%20the,fire)). While EU-wide consensus on sanctions is extremely difficult given divergent views, even raising the possibility marks a shift from blank-check support. Europe can also leverage its economic relationship: the EU is Israel’s largest trading partner. A clause in the EU-Israel Association Agreement ties cooperation to respect for human rights – the EU could invoke this to press Israel on issues like settlement expansion or treatment of Arab-Israeli citizens. Cutting or conditioning some of the preferential access Israel enjoys to EU programs (like Horizon Europe research funds) is another lever if behavior doesn’t align with basic norms.

However, Europe will not and should not abandon Israel’s right to exist and defend itself. The key is nuance: **support Israel’s legitimate security needs, but also champion Palestinian rights and statehood with equal vigor.** Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, phrased it well: Europe should be able to “recognize Israel’s right to defend itself, and at the same time be outraged by what is happening to civilians in Gaza... and defend Palestinians’ right to have a state” ([‘Our Credibility Is at Stake.’ How Divisions Over Israel’s War in Gaza Undermine the EU - DAWN](https://dawnmena.org/our-credibility-is-at-stake-how-divisions-over-israels-war-in-gaza-undermine-the-eu/#:~:text=By%20contrast%2C%20the%20EU%27s%20foreign,of%20harming%20or%20disliking%20Jews)). Doing so “without being accused of antisemitism” is important – Europe needs to make clear its stance is principled, not biased. Adopting Borrell’s balanced messaging as the European line would help.

**Reducing Uncritical Alignment with U.S.-Israel:** Historically, Europe often deferred to Washington on Middle East peace processes (e.g., following the U.S. lead in the Oslo process, the Quartet with U.S., UN, Russia). But the U.S., especially under some administrations, has heavily tilted toward Israel’s government positions (e.g. the Trump plan essentially sidelined Palestinians). Europe should be willing to chart its own course. That could involve _presenting its own peace initiative or parameters_ for a two-state solution. For instance, a unified EU position could outline the 1967 borders with land swaps as the basis, Jerusalem as a shared capital, an equitable resolution for refugees, and a robust security arrangement – and then actively lobby both sides and international players to accept it. Europe has significant aid leverage (it’s the biggest donor to the Palestinian Authority and to Palestinian refugees via UNRWA). It could condition future aid or diplomatic upgrades on constructive engagement in peace talks.

Europe can also engage with regional Arab states (like Egypt, Jordan, Gulf states) to form a coalition that pushes for negotiations – thereby not acting alone but as part of a larger front including the Arab Peace Initiative supporters. If the U.S. is not leading on peacemaking, Europe might fill that gap, which would raise its diplomatic stature. Of course, success isn’t guaranteed, but showing initiative is itself a mark of autonomy.

Additionally, Europe should ensure that _legitimate criticism of Israeli government policies is not conflated with hostility to Israel’s existence_. In recent Gaza war debates, some EU leaders (von der Leyen, for example) faced backlash for appearing one-sided ([‘Our Credibility Is at Stake.’ How Divisions Over Israel’s War in Gaza Undermine the EU - DAWN](https://dawnmena.org/our-credibility-is-at-stake-how-divisions-over-israels-war-in-gaza-undermine-the-eu/#:~:text=Six%20days%20after%20Hamas%27s%20attack%2C,the%20death%20toll%20drastically%20rose)) ([‘Our Credibility Is at Stake.’ How Divisions Over Israel’s War in Gaza Undermine the EU - DAWN](https://dawnmena.org/our-credibility-is-at-stake-how-divisions-over-israels-war-in-gaza-undermine-the-eu/#:~:text=Von%20der%20Leyen%20had%20effectively,the%20line%20member%20states%20agreed)). By carefully articulating positions (as Borrell did), Europe can maintain credibility. If Europe blindly follows the U.S.-Israel stance (e.g., vetoing UN resolutions calling for ceasefire or investigations), it undermines the EU’s claim to champion a rules-based order. In fact, the **Guardian noted Europe’s credibility gap**: united on Ukraine’s international law but divided and largely ineffective on Israel-Palestine ([‘Our Credibility Is at Stake.’ How Divisions Over Israel’s War in Gaza Undermine the EU - DAWN](https://dawnmena.org/our-credibility-is-at-stake-how-divisions-over-israels-war-in-gaza-undermine-the-eu/#:~:text=the%20European%20Union%20to%20act,Our%20credibility%20is%20at%20stake)) ([‘Our Credibility Is at Stake.’ How Divisions Over Israel’s War in Gaza Undermine the EU - DAWN](https://dawnmena.org/our-credibility-is-at-stake-how-divisions-over-israels-war-in-gaza-undermine-the-eu/#:~:text=Times.%20,our%20credibility)). Europe should close this gap to not “lose all our credibility” ([‘Our Credibility Is at Stake.’ How Divisions Over Israel’s War in Gaza Undermine the EU - DAWN](https://dawnmena.org/our-credibility-is-at-stake-how-divisions-over-israels-war-in-gaza-undermine-the-eu/#:~:text=match%20at%20L498%20Times.%20,we%20lose%20all%20our%20credibility)) in the eyes of the world.

**Impacts on Global Stage:** If Europe recalibrates its Israel-Palestine policy, it could reap significant diplomatic benefits. Many countries in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia sympathize with the Palestinian cause; a Europe seen as a more neutral arbiter could improve ties with these nations. For example, Europe often struggles to persuade global south countries to support its positions (like on Ukraine sanctions) because they perceive double standards. A fairer Europe in Middle East matters might make them more receptive to Europe’s other asks. Also, separating a bit from the U.S. line shows independence – which is the core theme of this whole strategy. It doesn’t mean being anti-Israel or pro-Palestinian in a biased way; it means being **pro-peace and pro-law**. Europe could position itself as the mediator that the U.S. cannot be (since the U.S. is seen as too close to Israel). If one day a peace deal is possible, Europe might be the broker who can talk to both sides credibly.

Moreover, _by reducing automatic alignment with U.S.-Israel policy_, Europe also frees itself to pursue relationships in the Middle East that suit its interests. For instance, Europe can maintain a constructive dialogue with Iran (as it tried through the JCPOA nuclear deal, even as the U.S. withdrew) to reduce regional tensions – something Israel often opposes. Europe can engage political actors like the Palestinian Authority or even non-violent elements of groups like Hamas in order to facilitate ceasefires or humanitarian deals, whereas the U.S. might forbid contact. These independent channels can be useful in crises (Europe has a history of backchannel communications, e.g., with Iran’s proxies in Lebanon to free hostages, etc.). Also, Europe could take a stronger role in Gaza’s aftermath – perhaps advocating an international trusteeship or a major reconstruction plan conditional on demilitarization, ideas that the U.S. is hesitant on but Europe could champion with UN support.

**Navigating Internal EU Divisions:** Achieving a unified European stance won’t be easy because member states vary: e.g., Germany and Austria feel a deep obligation to Israel and are highly sensitive to antisemitism, while Ireland and Sweden traditionally are more vocal for Palestinians. But consensus can be built around a moderate but clear line – support two states, condemn violence against civilians on all sides, oppose unilateral changes (settlements, annexation), support Israel’s security within 1967 lines, and use incentives and disincentives to push both towards negotiations. If outliers exist (like Hungary often breaks EU consensus on statements), the majority should still act via “coalitions of the willing” in diplomatic initiatives if needed.

**Recommended Actions (Middle East Policy):** (1) **Issue an EU declaration on Middle East Peace** that lays out parameters for a two-state solution and explicitly calls out the need for Israel to halt settlements and for Palestinians to reform governance and renounce terror. Use this as a basis to rally international support (reviving the Quartet or a new “Quint” including EU, U.S., UN, key Arab states). (2) **Leverage EU-Israel relations:** Warn that if settlement expansion continues or if Israel annexes West Bank land, the EU will respond (e.g., by labeling settlement products strictly or suspending parts of the Association Agreement). Conversely, offer to deepen EU-Israel scientific and economic cooperation if peace talks resume and human rights are respected. Essentially, put tangible incentives on the table for positive steps. (3) **Enhance support for Palestinians responsibly:** Maintain funding to the Palestinian Authority and UNRWA to avoid collapse, but push for accountability and anti-corruption efforts in the PA. Consider an EU-managed trust fund for Gaza reconstruction – money that flows if there is a ceasefire and if it’s used for civilian purposes, ensuring aid isn’t diverted. This gives Europe moral high ground and influence in Palestinian territories, rather than ceding that to, say, Qatar or Iran. (4) **Increase engagement with Arab partners:** Perhaps create an _EU+Arab States forum_ on the Palestine issue to coordinate pressure and peace efforts. Many Arab states have normalized with Israel (Abraham Accords); Europe can work with them to press Israel on Palestinian issues from a friendly angle. (5) **Decouple EU and US positions when necessary:** If the U.S. blocks a UN Security Council resolution that Europe deems reasonable (for example, a humanitarian pause in fighting), EU countries on the Council should consider abstaining or voting for it rather than automatically siding with the U.S. This sends a subtle but clear message of independent judgment. Over time, the U.S. might adapt by taking European views more seriously before wielding a veto.

In doing the above, Europe recalibrates without severing its important ties to Israel. It continues to fight antisemitism and ensure Israel’s security – those are non-negotiable European values given history and morality. But it also _earns credibility as a force for justice_ by actively standing up for Palestinian rights and a real peace. This balanced independence will make Europe a key shaper of Middle East outcomes, rather than a secondary player to the U.S. Moreover, it aligns Europe’s foreign policy with its broader strategic autonomy doctrine: not picking sides in an ideological way, but striving to uphold a stable, lawful international order. And that ultimately is in Europe’s interest – a peaceful Middle East means fewer security threats and refugee crises impacting Europe, and more economic opportunities with a stable region.

**Conclusion & Implementation Roadmap:** Europe’s assertion of sovereignty in a multipolar world is an ambitious endeavor, but as outlined above, it is achievable through concrete steps across security, industry, energy, and diplomacy. The following is a high-level roadmap summarizing key actions, investments, and timelines to operationalize this strategy:

- **By 2025:** Launch a _European Security Council_ comprising EU states (and open to UK/Turkey involvement) to begin planning NATO’s evolution and European defense union. Increase EU defense budget contributions to fund joint capabilities (at least €10 billion/year by EU and matching by states) ([Scaling up Weapons Production, Integrating Armed Forces | Internationale Politik Quarterly](https://ip-quarterly.com/en/scaling-weapons-production-integrating-armed-forces#:~:text=To%20advance%20this%20agenda%2C%20the,to%20products%20manufactured%20within%20Europe)). Conclude new readmission agreements to boost deportations of criminals and illegal entrants ([EU to propose new migration rules in latest rightward shift – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-migration-propose-rules-right-wing/#:~:text=The%20European%20Commission%20is%20set,to%20three%20European%20Union%20diplomats)). Convene an EU-AU summit to unveil the Africa partnership package. Finalize EU-Mercosur and Canada-Mexico alliance frameworks ([The Canada-EU Leaders' Meeting: A New Era of Cooperation? | Wilson Center](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/canada-eu-leaders-meeting-new-era-cooperation#:~:text=Amid%20the%20tensions%20and%20threats,trade%20negotiations%2C%20and%20promote%20multilateralism)). Issue the EU Middle East Peace declaration and appoint an EU Special Envoy for Middle East Peace to lead European diplomatic efforts.

- **2026–2027:** Gradually assume control of select U.S. military bases in Europe – for example, take command of an air base in Germany and an naval facility in Italy – turning them into European-led bases (budget ~€5 billion for upgrades). Achieve NATO’s 2% defense spending target across all EU members, with Germany surpassing it ([Germany pledges to make its military 'the backbone of defence in Europe' | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-pledges-make-its-military-the-backbone-defence-europe-2023-11-09/#:~:text=German%20Chancellor%20Olaf%20Scholz%20announced,the%20workings%20of%20the%20Bundeswehr)). Implement the European Defense Industrial Program: ensure 20–30% of new defense procurements are joint by 2027 ([Scaling up Weapons Production, Integrating Armed Forces | Internationale Politik Quarterly](https://ip-quarterly.com/en/scaling-weapons-production-integrating-armed-forces#:~:text=To%20advance%20this%20agenda%2C%20the,to%20products%20manufactured%20within%20Europe)). Ramp up European weapons production – e.g., 155mm artillery shell output to 3 times current levels ([Scaling up Weapons Production, Integrating Armed Forces | Internationale Politik Quarterly](https://ip-quarterly.com/en/scaling-weapons-production-integrating-armed-forces#:~:text=Current%20procurement%20processes%20are%20unnecessarily,Bundeswehr%20within%20just%20six%20months)) ([Scaling up Weapons Production, Integrating Armed Forces | Internationale Politik Quarterly](https://ip-quarterly.com/en/scaling-weapons-production-integrating-armed-forces#:~:text=extent%20advance%20orders%20for%20the,%E2%80%9D)). Reach 45% renewable energy in EU mix (on track for 2030 goal) to cut gas import needs ([The diverse picture of energy in Europe](https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/Europe/The-diverse-picture-of-energy-in-Europe-236083#:~:text=The%20diverse%20picture%20of%20energy,Energy%20demand%20among%20European)). Deploy Frontex 10,000 border force fully ([EU to propose new migration rules in latest rightward shift – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-migration-propose-rules-right-wing/#:~:text=Another%20possibility%20under%20discussion%20is,vanishing%2C%20the%20same%20diplomat%20said)), reducing illegal entries significantly. Ratify and bring into force the updated EU-Mexico FTA and an EU-India trade deal, diversifying export markets. Euro usage in global payments to rise via energy contracts in euros (possibly including LNG deals). Launch one or two major European tech “champion” projects (e.g., joint EU AI research center). Also by 2027, have a clear plan with timeline for Greenland: at least one EU-funded airport or mining project underway, and a formal agreement assuring EU access to rare earths ([Greenland: a geostrategic challenge for the European Union
  in the age of Trump 2.0](https://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/european-issues/778-greenland-a-geostrategic-challenge-for-the-european-union-in-the-age-of-trump-2-0#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%27s%20return%20to%20the,in%20a%20clearly%20strategic%20way)).

- **2028–2030:** With uncertainty about U.S. politics (possible Trump-like presidency in 2029), be prepared: The EU’s defensive “welcome package” and retaliation plans for any tariffs are updated and ready ([Facing Trump’s tariff war: A defensive blueprint for the EU | ECFR](https://ecfr.eu/article/facing-trumps-tariff-war-a-defensive-blueprint-for-the-eu/#:~:text=Juggling%20these%20demands%2C%20while%20maintaining,businesses%20if%20tariffs%20are%20imposed)). European Army/EU Defense Union initial operating capability – perhaps a 30,000-strong EU rapid reaction corps – established, able to deploy without U.S. support. European strategic airlift, satellite, and cyber units fully operational under EU command. Work with willing NATO allies to restructure NATO to a looser collective defense pact that recognizes EU autonomy (if U.S. is unwilling, Europe might maintain NATO for Article 5 but in parallel deepen EU structures to eventually replace it). Energy independence largely achieved: no Russian gas at all, limited U.S. LNG as needed, massive renewables online, electric grid integrated – making Europe a net exporter of green tech. Semiconductor fabs in Germany and France producing advanced 5 nm chips for European industry ([Chipmaker CEO says Washington’s anti-China tech blockade is a bad idea – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-tech-sovereignty-china-peter-wennink-asml/#:~:text=The%20EU%2C%20which%20wants%20to,computing%20and%20other%20advanced%20technologies)), reducing reliance on Asian supply. Green hydrogen produced domestically and via partnerships (e.g., with North Africa) fuels industrial needs, replacing imported gas.

- **2030 and beyond:** Europe reviews NATO’s future – possibly transitioning NATO into a new Euro-Atlantic Security Treaty where the U.S. and Canada support but Europeans lead, or keeping NATO but with Europe effectively self-sufficient. U.S. nuclear weapons likely removed from Europe by now, with France’s deterrent covering EU allies ([Europe targets homegrown nuclear deterrent as Trump sides with Putin – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-nuclear-weapons-nato-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-friedrich-merz/#:~:text=In%20what%20would%20be%20a,its%20nuclear%20protection%20through%20NATO)). Turkey potentially in EU or closely aligned, bolstering Europe’s defense posture significantly. Demographically and economically, Europe sustains itself via controlled immigration policies that supply ~+1 million skilled migrants per year (meeting labor needs) while minimizing irregular flows – migration is no longer a destabilizing crisis issue but managed.

- **Diplomatically**: Europe will have carved out a respected independent voice. Perhaps by 2030, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict sees a glimmer of progress with Europe mediating a regional peace conference. Russia, post-Putin, may have reengaged with Europe under a new treaty limiting arms and restoring trade – cementing peace in Eastern Europe (if not, Europe remains strong enough to deter any aggression alone). The EU likely has expanded (to include Western Balkans, maybe even a reformed Turkey and Scotland, etc.), increasing its weight. The euro could be challenging the dollar in certain regions as the preferred currency (particularly in Africa and parts of Asia). Europe’s economy, while not growing as fast as Asia, is robust due to innovation in green and digital sectors and less vulnerable to external shocks.

The overall **budget** for this grand strategy is substantial but within Europe’s means: It might involve an extra ~€100–150 billion per year pooled across the EU for defense, energy, and innovation combined – roughly 0.5-1% of EU GDP – which is affordable for the world’s second-largest economy. The political will and unity are the hardest parts, but as crises have shown (Eurozone crisis, COVID, Ukraine war), Europe can unite and act decisively when challenged.

In conclusion, this proposal lays out a bold yet realistic path for Europe to emerge as an independent pillar of the global order. By recalibrating alliances, boosting its own capacities, and standing firm on its values, Europe can ensure its **sovereignty, security, and prosperity** in the multipolar era. No longer a junior partner or bystander, Europe will be a shaper of the 21st century – cooperating with others as an equal and protecting its interests with confidence. The time to act is now; with vision and resolve, the European Union can solidify its place as a true global power.
