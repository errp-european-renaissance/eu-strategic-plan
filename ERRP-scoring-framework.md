# European Recovery and Resurgence Plan (ERRP) Alignment Scoring Framework

This framework evaluates how well each European nation – both EU members and hopeful entrants – aligns with the strategic objectives of the **European Recovery and Resurgence Plan (ERRP)**. It scores countries across four weighted categories, reflecting economic strength, military capacity, political stability, and geopolitical relevance. The total score (out of 100) indicates a country’s overall alignment with ERRP goals, guiding policymakers on where to direct investment, defense resources, and diplomatic focus.

## Categories and Weightings

**Each category contributes a portion of the total score** (weights in parentheses). Within each category, multiple indicators are assessed, and scores are updated dynamically as conditions change. Below we define each category, key metrics, and how countries are evaluated.

### 1. Economic Power (30%)

**Weight:** _30 points_ (30% of total) – Economic vitality is crucial for ERRP alignment, as a strong, growing economy underpins recovery efforts and resilience.

- **GDP Size & Growth:** The absolute size of a nation’s economy (GDP) and its growth trend over recent years. Larger economies naturally score higher, but sustained growth boosts the score for smaller countries. For example, Germany’s GDP ($4.7T in 2024) is about 24% of the EU total – larger than the combined GDP of 20 smaller EU economies ([Visualizing the European Union's $19 Trillion Economy](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-the-european-unions-19-trillion-economy/#:~:text=Germany%2C%20France%2C%20and%20Italy%20have,financial%20hubs%2C%20and%20manufacturing%20power)). Together, Germany, France ($3.2T), and Italy ($2.4T) form over half of the EU’s economic output ([Visualizing the European Union's $19 Trillion Economy](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-the-european-unions-19-trillion-economy/#:~:text=Germany%2C%20France%2C%20and%20Italy%20have,financial%20hubs%2C%20and%20manufacturing%20power)). We account for such dominance but also give credit to countries posting strong growth (e.g. **Ireland** or **Malta** with ~5% growth ([Visualizing the European Union's $19 Trillion Economy](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-the-european-unions-19-trillion-economy/#:~:text=However%2C%20these%20top%20three%20economies,or%20negative%20growth%20last%20year))).

- **Innovation & Industry:** Performance on innovation indices and industrial strength. Countries leading in R&D, high-tech industries, and digital economy get a boost. **Denmark** and **Sweden**, for instance, are top EU innovators ([European innovation scoreboard - European Commission](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/statistics/performance-indicators/european-innovation-scoreboard_en#:~:text=Denmark%20retained%20first%20position%20as,used%20for%20the%20performance%20groups)), which raises their economic score beyond what GDP alone would suggest. We incorporate the European Innovation Scoreboard and Global Innovation Index rankings to reward knowledge-driven economies.

- **Trade Competitiveness:** Export performance and trade balance. Surplus economies with strong export sectors score higher. For example, Germany and the Netherlands have long maintained large trade surpluses ([International trade in goods for the EU - an overview](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/International_trade_in_goods_for_the_EU_-_an_overview#:~:text=International%20trade%20in%20goods%20for,France%27s%20trade%20balance)), reflecting high competitiveness in manufacturing and logistics. By contrast, economies with chronic trade deficits or less integration in EU supply chains score lower. Openness to trade and diversification of export markets also factor into the score.

_Rationale:_ A country with a massive, innovative economy (like **Germany** or **France**) will likely score in the high 20s for Economic Power, whereas a smaller or less-developed economy (like **Albania** or **Moldova**) will score lower. However, rapid growth or niche strengths (e.g. Estonia’s digital economy) can partly compensate for size. This ensures the ERRP alignment metric favors not just scale, but also forward-looking economic health.

### 2. Military Strength (30%)

**Weight:** _30 points_ (30% of total) – Given the ERRP’s emphasis on a secure and resilient Europe, military capabilities are weighted on par with economic power. This category gauges a nation’s ability to contribute to European defense and security.

- **Defense Spending (% of GDP):** Defense investment indicates commitment to collective security. Countries meeting or exceeding NATO’s benchmark of 2% of GDP on defense score full marks on this sub-factor. (As of 2023, only 11 of 31 NATO members met the 2% target ([[PDF] Trends in World Military Expenditure, 2023 - SIPRI](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2024-04/2404_fs_milex_2023.pdf#:~:text=,4%20more%20than%20in%202022)).) For example, **Poland** (~3.8% of GDP on defense ([List of countries in Europe by military expenditures - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_in_Europe_by_military_expenditures#:~:text=Image%3A%20Norway%20Norway%20%201.61,34))) and the Baltic states are high scorers here, whereas countries like **Ireland** (~0.2%) and **Luxembourg** (~0.5%) score very low ([Government expenditure on defence - Statistics Explained](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Government_expenditure_on_defence#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20the%20highest%20levels,of%20GDP)). Consistent investment signals readiness; a rising defense budget trend also boosts the score.

- **Personnel & Readiness:** The size of active forces and their readiness level. Large, well-trained militaries with high readiness (e.g. **France’s** 200,000+ active troops and modern force posture) score strongly. Smaller countries with limited forces score lower, though participation in EU/NATO missions and reserves are considered. **Conscription or reserve systems** (as in Finland) that could be mobilized in crisis also add to readiness points.

- **Strategic Assets:** Possession of advanced military hardware and capabilities:

  - **Air Power:** Countries with sizeable air forces (fighter jets, transport, drones) get credit. For instance, **France** and **Italy** field advanced multi-role jet fleets, contributing to higher scores.
  - **Naval Power:** For maritime states, the navy’s strength (major warships, submarines) is included. **France** (with an aircraft carrier and ocean-going navy) and **Italy** or **Spain** (with modern frigates and submarines) score well here, whereas landlocked nations have this factor weighted less (not penalized for no navy).
  - **Nuclear Deterrence:** France’s independent nuclear arsenal is a unique asset – as the **sole EU nuclear power with 290 warheads** ([France wants to extend its nuclear umbrella to Europe. But is ...](https://thebulletin.org/2024/05/france-wants-to-extend-its-nuclear-umbrella-to-europe-but-is-macron-ready-to-trade-paris-for-helsinki/#:~:text=France%20wants%20to%20extend%20its,the%20world%27s%20fourth%20arsenal)), France gains maximum points in this sub-factor for providing a deterrent umbrella that aligns with European security interests.

- **Global Firepower Index:** We incorporate composite military strength rankings (e.g. Global Firepower). According to 2025 rankings of **European military power**, the strongest national forces are the U.K., France, Italy, and Germany ([European Military Strength (2025) - Global Firepower](https://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing-europe.php#:~:text=Firepower%20www,Germany)). For EU alignment scoring, we consider **France** as the top EU military contributor (Global Firepower rank #7 worldwide) ([2025 France Military Strength - Global Firepower](https://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.php?country_id=france#:~:text=2025%20France%20Military%20Strength%20,score%20of%200.1878)), followed by Italy and Germany (both among the top 15 globally). Non-EU NATO allies (UK, Turkey) are noted for comparison when evaluating entrants.

_Rationale:_ A country with robust spending, large forces, and advanced equipment (like **France**, which scores in the high 20s or full 30) will rank at the top. Mid-sized powers (e.g. **Italy**, **Poland**, **Spain**) score in the 15–25 range depending on their recent defense build-up. Smaller nations with minimal militaries (e.g. **Malta**) score near zero in this category. This rewards nations that bolster Europe’s defense – a core ERRP aim – and incentivizes others to increase readiness (for example, **Germany’s** recent commitment of €100B to rebuild its Bundeswehr can improve its future score).

### 3. Political Stability (20%)

**Weight:** _20 points_ (20% of total) – Stability and good governance are essential for a sustained recovery and unity in Europe. This category assesses the internal political climate, institutional strength, and social cohesion.

- **Government Effectiveness & Rule of Law:** We use indicators like the World Governance Index and Transparency International scores. Countries with low corruption and efficient administrations (e.g. **Nordic states**) score highest. **Scandinavian countries** consistently rank at the top for governance and rule of law, indicating strong institutional stability. Conversely, nations where rule of law is eroding or corruption is high (e.g. **Bulgaria**, **Serbia**) lose points.

- **Electoral Stability and Populism:** Recent election results and government compositions are examined. Peaceful transfers of power and centrist coalitions earn high marks, whereas **fragmented parliaments or extremist surges** reduce stability scores. For example, long-standing democracies like **Germany** (despite a three-party coalition, it remains stable and centrist) rate well. In contrast, the rise of far-right or anti-establishment parties is flagged. _As of 2024, multiple EU countries have seen surging support for radical right parties_, which could signal instability ([As Europe votes, a populist wave surges  – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-election-vote-populist-wave-alternative-for-germany-national-rally/#:~:text=BRUSSELS%20%E2%80%94%20On%20the%20brink,have%20a%20loud%20global%20echo)) ([As Europe votes, a populist wave surges  – POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-election-vote-populist-wave-alternative-for-germany-national-rally/#:~:text=In%20recent%20days%2C%20far,French%20President%20Emmanuel%20Macron%20and)). Nations where far-right parties **entered government or prop up coalitions** – Italy, Hungary, Poland (until 2023), Finland, Sweden, Slovakia – get dinged on this metric ([Europe - 5 risks to watch | Maplecroft](https://www.maplecroft.com/products-and-solutions/geopolitical-and-country-risk/insights/europe-5-risks-to-watch/#:~:text=Europe%20is%20the%20worst%20performing,third%20of%20EU%20member%20states)). The framework dynamically adjusts to election outcomes; for instance, Poland’s score is now improving after its pro-EU opposition won in 2023, whereas **Italy’s** score fell when a populist-right coalition took power in 2022.

- **Civil Unrest & Social Cohesion:** Frequency of protests, strikes, or social unrest is considered. Countries that have experienced significant protests or social turmoil recently see slight score reductions. For example, **France’s** waves of street protests (e.g. over pension reforms) and **Spain’s** Catalan tensions are noted as factors that _moderately_ temper their stability scores. On the other hand, societies with high cohesion and rarely disrupted by unrest (e.g. **Denmark**) score near the maximum. We also factor in ethnic or regional conflicts (for entrants: e.g. **Bosnia’s** ethnic divisions or **Serbia-Kosovo** tensions significantly lower stability scores).

- **Longevity and Continuity:** The durability of the current government and likelihood of abrupt changes. A recent history of snap elections or unstable coalitions (as seen in **Bulgaria** or **Slovenia** with frequent government turnovers) negatively impacts scoring. Conversely, countries with a record of stable governments completing full terms (e.g. **Portugal** or **Lithuania**) benefit. External expert assessments – such as Maplecroft’s Government Stability Index – are used as benchmarks. _Notably, Europe as a region has seen political volatility recently_: one analysis found **Europe to be the worst-performing region on a predictive stability index in early 2024** due to potential swings to the right in many states ([Europe - 5 risks to watch | Maplecroft](https://www.maplecroft.com/products-and-solutions/geopolitical-and-country-risk/insights/europe-5-risks-to-watch/#:~:text=Europe%20is%20the%20worst%20performing,third%20of%20EU%20member%20states)). Such trends are captured in our scoring updates.

_Rationale:_ A nation with strong institutions and steady politics (like **Sweden** or **Netherlands**) might score 18–20 points. Countries with some concerns – mild populist influence or occasional protests (e.g. **France**, **Italy**) – fall in the mid-range ~12–16. Severe cases of instability (e.g. governments teetering or democracy backsliding as in **Hungary** or **Turkey**) score in single digits. By quantifying stability, the ERRP alignment score highlights where governance reforms or efforts to rebuild public trust are needed for full participation in Europe’s resurgence.

### 4. Geopolitical Relevance (20%)

**Weight:** _20 points_ (20% of total) – This category measures a country’s strategic importance and its alignment with broader European geopolitical goals. It captures both geography and diplomacy: how a nation’s location and foreign policy stance contribute to European security and resilience.

- **Strategic Location & Border Security:** Countries situated at crucial geopolitical junctures or external EU borders gain points due to their importance in European security. For example, **Poland** and the **Baltic states** (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) are on the front line of NATO’s eastern flank; their proximity to Russia/Belarus and role in the Ukraine crisis heighten their relevance. These nations have become linchpins in EU/NATO defense strategy, so they score high in this sub-factor. Similarly, **Greece** and **Italy**, as frontline states for Mediterranean migration routes, and **Finland** (with a newly doubled EU-Russia border after joining NATO), are recognized for regional strategic importance. In contrast, a small inland country like **Luxembourg** or **Ireland** (far from conflict zones) would score lower here.

- **Diplomatic Influence & Alliances:** We evaluate each country’s contributions to international institutions and diplomatic clout:

  - Within the EU, holding key leadership roles or driving major initiatives (e.g. **France** and **Germany** often spearhead EU policy, so they score maximally on intra-EU influence).
  - **NATO contributions:** Commitment to NATO missions, leadership in alliance initiatives, or hosting NATO facilities boosts the score. For instance, **Italy** hosts important NATO bases, and **Poland** is establishing a new permanent U.S. military presence – these add to their influence.
  - **UN and global presence:** France gains a unique advantage as **the only EU member with a permanent UN Security Council seat** ([The European Union and the United Nations | EEAS](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/un-new-york/european-union-and-united-nations_en?s=63#:~:text=In%20January%202025%2C%20Denmark%20and,seat%20on%20the%20Security%20Council)), amplifying its global diplomatic weight. Countries active in UN peacekeeping or international mediation (such as **Sweden** or **Norway** for entrants) also get credit.
  - Participation in regional groups (e.g. Visegrád, Three Seas Initiative, OSCE chairmanships, etc.) can incrementally affect scores.

- **Alignment with EU Security & Foreign Policy:** Perhaps the most qualitative sub-factor, this gauges to what extent a country’s foreign policy aligns with the EU consensus on major issues (sanctions, relations with rivals, etc.):

  - Countries fully in sync with EU common foreign and security policy (CFSP) – e.g. uniformly supporting sanctions on aggressor states, backing EU positions at the UN – score highest.
  - **Outliers within the EU**, such as **Hungary** (often dissenting on Russia sanctions or EU statements) see a deduction. If a member is perceived as a potential “weak link” that external powers could exploit ([‘Lifting Up Our Values at Home’: How to Revitalize NATO’s Political Cohesion](https://www.csis.org/analysis/lifting-our-values-home-how-revitalize-natos-political-cohesion#:~:text=and%20friendly%20international%20relations,threaten%20to%20undermine%20its%20unity)) ([‘Lifting Up Our Values at Home’: How to Revitalize NATO’s Political Cohesion](https://www.csis.org/analysis/lifting-our-values-home-how-revitalize-natos-political-cohesion#:~:text=starting%20with%20an%20erosion%20of,threaten%20to%20undermine%20its%20unity)), their geopolitical alignment score suffers.
  - For candidate countries, this is a crucial differentiator: **Serbia**, for example, scores very low because it remains the only Western Balkan aspirant that _has not aligned with EU sanctions on Russia_ ([Sanctions on Russia are main obstacle to Serbia's EU bid - PM Brnabic | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/sanctions-russia-are-main-obstacle-serbias-eu-bid-pm-brnabic-2023-02-10/#:~:text=BELGRADE%2C%20Feb%2010%20%28Reuters%29%20,set%20by%20the%20bloc)), directly contradicting EU foreign policy. Its balancing between East and West is noted as “the condition above all conditions” holding back EU accession ([Sanctions on Russia are main obstacle to Serbia's EU bid - PM Brnabic | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/sanctions-russia-are-main-obstacle-serbias-eu-bid-pm-brnabic-2023-02-10/#:~:text=BELGRADE%2C%20Feb%2010%20%28Reuters%29%20,set%20by%20the%20bloc)). In contrast, **Montenegro** or **North Macedonia**, which consistently align with EU positions, score higher.
  - Contributions to European initiatives (like PESCO defense projects or regional security missions) also indicate alignment. **Turkey**, while a NATO member, often diverges from EU stances (e.g. buying Russian S-400 missiles despite NATO objections ([‘Lifting Up Our Values at Home’: How to Revitalize NATO’s Political Cohesion](https://www.csis.org/analysis/lifting-our-values-home-how-revitalize-natos-political-cohesion#:~:text=commitment%20to%20promote%20%E2%80%9Cpeaceful%20and,undermine%20NATO%20integrated%20air%20defense)), or vetoing NATO defense plans due to its own disputes ([‘Lifting Up Our Values at Home’: How to Revitalize NATO’s Political Cohesion](https://www.csis.org/analysis/lifting-our-values-home-how-revitalize-natos-political-cohesion#:~:text=alliance%2C%20blocking%20Ukraine%E2%80%99s%20NATO%20Membership,as%20a%20terrorist%20organization))). Such actions significantly lower Turkey’s alignment sub-score – despite its large military, its geopolitical **alignment** with Europe’s goals is inconsistent.

- **Regional Leadership:** Some countries punch above their weight regionally – e.g. **Poland** has emerged as a leader in Eastern Europe (supporting Ukraine, advocating for energy security), and **Sweden** (prior to EU membership, the UK often played this role) in Northern Europe. These leadership roles, where recognized, can add a minor bonus.

_Rationale:_ A country like **France** maximizes this category (≈20/20) due to its global role, UNSC seat, nuclear deterrent, and frequent alignment at the forefront of EU strategy. **Germany** also scores very high, though lacking nuclear/UNSC, it compensates by economic/diplomatic heft within Europe. **Poland** and **Italy** score in the mid-to-high teens, reflecting strong regional roles. Smaller or more neutral states (e.g. **Ireland**, which is militarily non-aligned but EU-loyal diplomatically) get moderate scores ~10. Countries undermining European unity or peripheral to strategic issues score low: for instance, **Hungary’s** friendly stance toward Russia and internal EU vetoes put it near the bottom in alignment, and **Turkey** (as a candidate) also scores low despite strategic geography, because its interests often diverge from the EU’s. This category ensures the ERRP alignment score favors nations that _strengthen_ Europe’s collective geopolitical posture and identifies those whose policies need realignment.

## Dynamic Scoring Adjustments (Real-Time Factors)

A hallmark of this framework is its **responsiveness to current events**. Scores are not static – they adjust as countries make progress or face setbacks. We incorporate fresh data on elections, leadership changes, economic shocks, or conflicts as they happen:

- **Elections & Leadership Changes:** After any national election, we reassess Political Stability and Geopolitical Alignment. A clear win by a pro-EU, stable government can raise stability scores (e.g. the Netherlands forming a stable coalition would bump its score). Conversely, if an election yields a hung parliament or significant extremist gains, the stability score drops. _Example:_ Recent polls show **far-right parties gaining strength across Europe** and potentially becoming the 3rd largest bloc in the EU Parliament ([Europe - 5 risks to watch | Maplecroft](https://www.maplecroft.com/products-and-solutions/geopolitical-and-country-risk/insights/europe-5-risks-to-watch/#:~:text=The%20biggest%20barometer%20of%20European,may%20also%20give%20the%20far)). If realized, countries like **Austria** or **Germany** (where AfD surges in state elections ([Europe - 5 risks to watch | Maplecroft](https://www.maplecroft.com/products-and-solutions/geopolitical-and-country-risk/insights/europe-5-risks-to-watch/#:~:text=parliamentary%20polls%20in%20June%2C%20where,Europe%E2%80%99s%20biggest%20economy%20in%202025))) could see slight downgrades in stability until their political direction clarifies. On the flip side, **Slovakia’s** 2023 election, which brought a populist party to power, triggered an immediate reduction in its scores for Political Stability and Alignment (given the new government’s Euroscepticism).

- **Economic Crises or Booms:** GDP and fiscal data are tracked yearly. A recession or debt crisis (for instance, if a country’s economy sharply contracted or if it required an EU bailout) would reduce the Economic Power score until recovery is evident. Inflation surges that erode consumer stability may also factor in slightly. Meanwhile, a country discovering new growth (say through tech sector expansion or energy exports) would see its economic sub-scores rise. _Example:_ The 2022 spike in energy prices hurt energy-importing economies (like **Germany** or **Italy**), and our 2023 update reflected a slight dip in their economic outlook, whereas gas-exporting **Norway** (an EEA member, potential entrant) improved.

- **Military Conflicts & Security Developments:** The outbreak of war or resolution of conflicts can swing Military and Geopolitical scores. The most salient example is Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 – this **dramatically elevated Poland’s and the Baltics’ strategic relevance**, leading us to increase their Geopolitical scores due to frontline status and leadership in the EU response. It also spurred many countries to boost defense spending (e.g. **Germany’s Zeitenwende**, Finland and Sweden joining NATO), which we incorporated as positive shifts in Military Strength scores in 2022–2024. For entrants like **Ukraine**, the war has paradoxically _boosted_ its Military Strength score (due to hardened combat experience and Western equipment deliveries) while tragically hammering its economy and stability (huge drops in GDP and internal displacement). We adjust Ukraine’s scores frequently as the situation evolves. If conflicts subside (e.g. a lasting peace in Eastern Ukraine or normalization between Serbia and Kosovo), the affected countries would regain stability points.

- **Emerging Risks (Alerts):** The framework has a “risk flag” system highlighting potential future score changes:
  - **NATO Disunity Risk:** If events indicate cracks in NATO or transatlantic unity, we note this under Geopolitical relevance. _For instance, a 2020 NATO report warned that “a drift toward NATO disunity must be seen as a strategic…problem.”_ ([‘Lifting Up Our Values at Home’: How to Revitalize NATO’s Political Cohesion](https://www.csis.org/analysis/lifting-our-values-home-how-revitalize-natos-political-cohesion#:~:text=NATO%20Experts%20Group%20report%2C%20%E2%80%9Ca,allies%20have%20nonetheless%20lacked%20the)). If a NATO member (say Turkey or Hungary) severely obstructs alliance consensus, our model flags it. This could presage a downgrade in alignment scores if not resolved. We similarly watch the U.S. political climate (e.g. talk of reduced support to Europe) as an external factor – while not directly scoring European countries, such trends increase the importance of EU members’ own defense efforts (prompting, for example, an upward pressure on Military Strength scoring thresholds for top marks).
  - **Migration Crises:** A sudden influx of refugees can strain border states and EU unity, so we integrate such developments. _For example, 2023–24 saw the **highest number of asylum applications in the EU since 2016**, straining processing and accommodation resources ([Understanding Europe’s turn on migration](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/understanding-europes-turn-on-migration/#:~:text=migration%20in%20Europe%20toward%20a,service%20provision%2C%20and%20thus%20integration))._ Countries like Italy, Greece, or Cyprus facing disproportionate pressures might get temporary negative modifiers in stability (due to social tensions) and in geopolitical relevance (due to urgent border security challenges). At the same time, we credit cooperative efforts to handle the crisis (e.g. if EU states formulate a new pact or if frontline states improve border management, as in the 2023 EU Pact on Migration ([Understanding Europe’s turn on migration](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/understanding-europes-turn-on-migration/#:~:text=In%20the%20aftermath%20of%20Europe%E2%80%99s,EU%20states%20to%20limit%20movement))).
  - **Populist Surges:** We continually monitor opinion polls and protest movements. If, say, a far-right party is polling toward an unprecedented victory in **France** or **Spain**, we preemptively highlight that as a risk to the stability score (though we would only adjust the score upon actual political impact). The framework report might annotate such countries with an “emerging risk: populism” warning. Recent trends show that even mainstream governments have adopted tougher stances on issues like immigration due to populist pressure ([Understanding Europe’s turn on migration](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/understanding-europes-turn-on-migration/#:~:text=one%20election%20after%20another%20has,also%20severely%20distorted%20the%20debate)) ([Understanding Europe’s turn on migration](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/understanding-europes-turn-on-migration/#:~:text=The%20results%20of%20the%20European,service%20provision%2C%20and%20thus%20integration)), which is noted qualitatively in our analysis for policymakers.

**In summary**, the ERRP alignment scores are **updated in near real-time** as new data emerge. This ensures relevance: policymakers using this tool will always see a snapshot that reflects the latest reality – whether it’s a sudden economic downturn, an election surprise, or a security crisis. Each update comes with a brief explanation of what changed and why (for transparency). This dynamic approach helps Europe’s leaders spot quickly where momentum is shifting, and which countries might need urgent attention or support under the ERRP.

## Current Rankings of EU Members and Candidates

Below is the **ranked list** of 27 EU member states **plus key candidate countries**, based on the latest composite scores (out of 100). The scores reflect the weighted sum of Economic, Military, Political, and Geopolitical metrics discussed. High-ranking countries are most aligned with ERRP objectives, possessing robust economies, strong defense commitments, stable governance, and strategic importance. Lower-ranking countries have shortfalls in one or more areas that hamper their alignment with Europe’s recovery and resilience agenda.

**Top Tier – Leaders of European Recovery:** These countries significantly outperform others in multiple categories, making them linchpins of the ERRP:

1. **France** – **Score: 88/100.** _France_ tops the list as the most well-rounded power in Europe. It boasts a large, diversified economy, a top-tier military (the EU’s strongest, with nuclear capabilities ([France wants to extend its nuclear umbrella to Europe. But is ...](https://thebulletin.org/2024/05/france-wants-to-extend-its-nuclear-umbrella-to-europe-but-is-macron-ready-to-trade-paris-for-helsinki/#:~:text=France%20wants%20to%20extend%20its,the%20world%27s%20fourth%20arsenal))), solid political institutions (despite periodic protests), and unparalleled geopolitical clout (UNSC veto power and global reach) ([The European Union and the United Nations | EEAS](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/un-new-york/european-union-and-united-nations_en?s=63#:~:text=In%20January%202025%2C%20Denmark%20and,seat%20on%20the%20Security%20Council)). France is fully aligned with ERRP priorities: it invests in defense (1.9% of GDP and rising) and leads in EU strategic autonomy initiatives. _Areas to watch:_ social unrest and any future populist electoral swings, but currently France sets the benchmark for ERRP alignment.

2. **Germany** – **Score: 85/100.** _Germany_ is Europe’s economic engine – with **24% of EU GDP** ([Visualizing the European Union's $19 Trillion Economy](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-the-european-unions-19-trillion-economy/#:~:text=Germany%2C%20France%2C%20and%20Italy%20have,financial%20hubs%2C%20and%20manufacturing%20power)), it anchors the recovery plan financially. Its political stability is high (consensus-driven governance, though the new coalition faces policy challenges). Germany’s only relative weakness has been military strength – historically low defense spending (~1.5% GDP ([List of countries in Europe by military expenditures - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_in_Europe_by_military_expenditures#:~:text=Image%3A%20Finland%20Finland%20%202.42,61))) kept its score slightly below France. However, with the recent boost in defense funding and commitment to NATO, Germany’s military score is improving. Geopolitically, Germany’s influence is enormous in the EU (leadership in diplomacy, sanctions, and aid). Continued increases in defense readiness and maintaining unity in its coalition will keep Germany near the top.

3. **United Kingdom** (**_Possible Re-entrant_** – _Score: 83/100_). Although no longer an EU member, the **UK** is included as a “benchmark” possible future entrant given its importance. The UK remains a European heavyweight: a $3.4T economy, one of the world’s top 5 militaries, nuclear weapons, and permanent UNSC membership. In this scoring, the UK shines in Economic and Military categories and retains strong geopolitical ties to Europe (through NATO and G7). Its Political Stability has improved after recent volatility. _Note:_ The UK’s alignment score is slightly reduced by the fact that, outside the EU, it’s not party to ERRP or EU policy – but in a scenario where it were to rejoin or closely align, it would be a top-tier contributor. (For now, we treat it hypothetically; actual entrants below are non-EU states aspiring to join.)

4. **Italy** – **Score: 75/100.** _Italy_ has the EU’s third-largest economy and is key to a successful European recovery ([Visualizing the European Union's $19 Trillion Economy](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-the-european-unions-19-trillion-economy/#:~:text=Germany%2C%20France%2C%20and%20Italy%20have,financial%20hubs%2C%20and%20manufacturing%20power)). It scores very high in Economic Power (strong industrial base, though growth has been sluggish). Italy’s military is respectable – ranked **#3 in Europe by composite power** ([European Military Strength (2025) - Global Firepower](https://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing-europe.php#:~:text=Firepower%20www,Germany)) – with significant air and naval assets; however, spending is just around NATO’s 2% target. Political Stability is Italy’s weak spot: frequent government changes and the recent rise of a populist-right coalition have lowered its stability score. Geopolitically, Italy is important (Mediterranean security, EU founding member) but not as globally influential as France/Germany. To improve, Italy should focus on governance reforms and consistent policies to shake off its “fragile coalition” reputation.

5. **Poland** – **Score: 72/100.** _Poland_ emerges as a leader among the newer EU members, thanks to rapid improvements. Economically, Poland is now a top-6 economy in the EU (nearly $0.9T GDP) and growing robustly. Its **defense spending is one of the highest in NATO (3.8% of GDP)** ([List of countries in Europe by military expenditures - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_in_Europe_by_military_expenditures#:~:text=Image%3A%20Netherlands%20Netherlands%20%201.53,85)), and it is undergoing one of Europe’s most ambitious military modernizations (ordering new tanks, jets, air defenses). This pushes Poland’s Military Strength score to one of the highest in Europe. Geopolitical relevance is another strong suit – Poland is the frontline supporting Ukraine and has become vital to EU security strategy. The recent election (2023) eased concerns about rule-of-law issues, improving its Political Stability and alignment with EU values. Poland still lags a bit in innovation and per-capita wealth (dragging its Economic score slightly), but it is clearly a rising power fully aligning with ERRP’s security and growth objectives.

6. **Spain** – **Score: 70/100.** _Spain_ combines a large economy (4th in EU) with moderate military and stable politics. Its Economic Power is solid (strong in services, tourism, and some industry), though unemployment remains an issue. Spain’s Military Strength is middle-of-the-pack – it spends around 1.5% GDP on defense and fields capable but not large forces. Politically, Spain is generally stable, though polarization around Catalonia and a delicate coalition balance exist. Geopolitically, Spain is crucial for Mediterranean affairs and transatlantic links (Rota naval base for NATO, etc.), but less so in Eastern Europe. Spain’s ERRP alignment is good and could improve by investing more in defense modernization and maintaining social cohesion amid regional disputes.

7. **Netherlands** – **Score: 68/100.** _Netherlands_ punches above its weight economically (5th largest EU GDP despite a small population) ([Visualizing the European Union's $19 Trillion Economy](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-the-european-unions-19-trillion-economy/#:~:text=Spain%20and%20the%20Netherlands%20round,of%20the%20total)), with very high innovation and trade (a global logistics hub). It scores max in Economic Power per size. Military-wise, the Dutch have a modern, professional force but on the smaller side (spending ~1.5% GDP). Political Stability in the Netherlands has been traditionally high, though the government collapse in 2023 over immigration policy briefly flagged a risk. Overall governance and rule of law remain excellent. Geopolitically, the Netherlands is influential in EU decision-making (a founding member, often shaping finance and trade policy) but not a global power on its own. Its alignment with ERRP is strong; consistent defense investments and successful coalition-building after elections will keep its score high.

8. **Sweden** – **Score: 66/100.** _Sweden_ is a highly developed economy (innovation leader, home to global companies) and scores very high on Political Stability and rule of law. It recently joined NATO, reflecting a major policy shift that will boost its Military Strength score over time. Currently, Sweden’s military is small but well-equipped (and it plans to reach 2% GDP defense spending). Geopolitically, Sweden’s importance rose with NATO membership, securing Northern Europe’s flank. However, a right-wing party now informally supports the government, which introduces some policy uncertainty (a slight dip in stability score). Overall, Sweden aligns closely with ERRP goals, especially on green and digital transitions. Improvements in military capacity (already underway) will further elevate its position.

9. **Romania** – **Score: 60/100.** _Romania_ represents the improving Eastern EU. Its economy is mid-sized but growing fast, with potential in industry and IT. Military spending is around 2% GDP, and Romania hosts U.S./NATO forces and Aegis Ashore missile defense – boosting its strategic value. Politically, Romania has improved stability after earlier turbulence (though corruption still drags on its governance score somewhat). Geopolitically, Romania is key on the Black Sea and a neighbor to the Ukraine conflict, giving it higher relevance. It reliably aligns with EU/NATO stances. Romania’s ERRP alignment is bolstered by its commitment to defense and pro-EU outlook; continued judicial reforms and anti-corruption efforts would raise its stability (and thus overall score) further.

10. **Turkey** (**_EU Candidate_**) – **Score: 58/100.** _Turkey_ is a unique case: a NATO member with a powerful military and large economy, but its alignment with EU principles is tenuous. Turkey scores extremely well in Military Strength (second only to France in Europe in manpower and hardware) and its economy (G20 size) would rank around 6th in the EU, though inflation and instability have eroded some economic points recently. However, **Political Stability** is low – Turkey’s government is increasingly authoritarian, and democratic indices are poor (placing it well below any current EU member in this regard). Geopolitically, Turkey is both vital (controlling Black Sea access, migrant routes, and as a Muslim-majority regional power) and misaligned (its interests in Syria, the East Med, and relations with Russia often clash with the EU). Indeed, _Türkiye is the only country in Europe ranked outside the top half of the Global Peace Index due to internal and external conflicts_ ([Global Peace Index Map » The Most & Least Peaceful Countries](https://www.visionofhumanity.org/maps/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20For%20the%20fifth%20consecutive,top%20half%20of%20the%20index)). Thus, despite raw power, Turkey’s ERRP alignment score is dragged down by governance and foreign policy misalignment. Unless Turkey dramatically reforms (improving rule of law, rights, and syncing with EU foreign policy), it remains an outlier – a strong nation _not fully aligned_ with European resurgence objectives.

11. **Greece** – **Score: 56/100.** _Greece_ has rebounded economically from its debt crisis, but its GDP size remains modest in EU context. It scores decently on Economic Power due to recent growth and EU funds absorption. Greece shines in Military Strength: it spends **over 3% of GDP on defense** (driven by Aegean tensions) ([Government expenditure on defence - Statistics Explained](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Government_expenditure_on_defence#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20the%20highest%20levels,of%20GDP)), one of EU’s highest, and fields a large military for its size (with advanced jets and a sizable navy). This commitment boosts its alignment score. Political Stability in Greece has improved after reforms – the government re-elected in 2023 is pro-EU and fairly stable, raising its stability score compared to the turbulent 2010s. Geopolitically, Greece is on the frontline of both Eastern Mediterranean security (facing Turkey’s pressure) and migration flows, which makes it strategically important for the EU. It aligns closely with EU policies. To improve further, Greece should continue economic reforms to increase competitiveness (lifting its economic score) and work with neighbors to reduce regional disputes, but it’s firmly in the middle tier of ERRP alignment now.

12. **Portugal** – **Score: 55/100.** _Portugal_ is a stable, mid-sized EU economy with high governance scores. It ranks similar to Greece overall. Economic Power: Portugal is service-oriented and has moderate GDP, with some growth but also high debt – a middling score here. Military: around 1.5% GDP spending, with a small force, so fairly low military score (Portugal often relies on NATO allies for strategic lift). Political Stability is a strong point – generally smooth center-left governance and low extremism. Geopolitically, Portugal’s western location means it’s less central to EU security crises, but it is an Atlantic nation with ties to Africa and Latin America, adding some diplomatic value. It’s a loyal EU/NATO member. ERRP alignment is solid; Portugal’s scores would rise by modestly increasing defense contributions and continuing to foster innovation in its economy.

13. **Finland** – **Score: 54/100.** _Finland_ shares many attributes with its Nordic neighbors: very high political stability and governance, a high-tech economy (albeit smaller in size), and now as of 2023, a NATO member. Finland’s Economic Power score is moderate (its population is small, but per capita it's wealthy). Its Military Strength saw a **jump after joining NATO** – Finland already spent over 2% GDP on defense and has a large reserve army relative to population, as well as modern artillery and incoming F-35 jets. Political Stability dipped slightly with the inclusion of a far-right party in the new coalition (an outlier in Finland’s consensus politics), but institutions remain strong. Geopolitically, Finland’s relevance surged: it now shares the EU’s longest direct border with Russia, making it pivotal for Baltic security. Finland aligns 100% with EU policies (as a Russia neighbor, it’s been hawkish on sanctions and defense). Expect Finland’s score to continue climbing as it integrates into NATO structures and if it maintains domestic unity on foreign policy.

14. **Ukraine** (**_EU Candidate_**) – **Score: 50/100.** _Ukraine_’s alignment score is the most volatile given it’s in an active war for survival. Pre-war, Ukraine would score lower, but the war has drastically altered its profile:

    - **Military Strength:** Ukraine now has a battle-hardened military with huge mobilization (over a million under arms) and is receiving cutting-edge Western weaponry. Its defense spending is off the charts (over one-third of GDP in 2023) ([List of countries in Europe by military expenditures - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_in_Europe_by_military_expenditures#:~:text=Image%3A%20Slovenia%20Slovenia%20%201.34,26)). We give Ukraine a near-max military score for its demonstrated capability and commitment to European security – it’s literally fighting a war that aligns with European security interests. However, this is balanced by reliance on Western aid; absent that aid, its score would be lower.
    - **Economic Power:** This is Ukraine’s weakest point now – the economy has shrunk significantly due to the war (infrastructure destroyed, millions displaced). So Ukraine’s economic score is very low (comparable to the poorest European states). ERRP would heavily focus on Ukraine’s reconstruction in coming years.
    - **Political Stability:** Wartime unity has actually solidified Ukraine’s political stability to an extent (current wartime government has high public support and curtailed infighting). But under the surface, there are challenges – martial law, deferred elections, and the need for anti-corruption reforms. We give a mixed score here.
    - **Geopolitical Relevance:** Extremely high – Ukraine is at the center of Europe’s biggest security crisis since WWII. Its future will heavily influence European stability. We assign maximum relevance due to its importance in containing Russian aggression and its potential EU candidacy momentum.

    Ukraine’s composite 50 reflects a tale of two extremes (very high in mil/geo, low in econ). If peace comes and reconstruction begins, Ukraine’s economic score (and overall alignment) will rapidly rise, especially as it adopts EU laws and reforms for accession. In essence, Ukraine is _vital but vulnerable_ in the ERRP context – a top priority for support.

15. **Hungary** – **Score: 48/100.** _Hungary_ is the lowest-scoring current EU member in our ranking. While it has a decent economy and a capable military on paper, its **political and alignment issues** drag it down. Hungary’s Economic Power is moderate (middle-income economy, with some manufacturing; heavy EU fund recipient). Military spending is around 2% and they are upgrading equipment, so Hungary’s Military score is fair. **Political Stability**, however, is problematic: Hungary has an **erosion of democratic norms** noted by Freedom House ([‘Lifting Up Our Values at Home’: How to Revitalize NATO’s Political Cohesion](https://www.csis.org/analysis/lifting-our-values-home-how-revitalize-natos-political-cohesion#:~:text=and%20friendly%20international%20relations,threaten%20to%20undermine%20its%20unity)) – effectively one-party rule under Orban, with weakening checks and balances. This lowers its stability and rule-of-law score significantly. Geopolitically, Hungary often **breaks EU unity** – e.g. vetoing EU sanctions or statements against Russia/China. It blocked NATO–Ukraine meetings over minority issues ([‘Lifting Up Our Values at Home’: How to Revitalize NATO’s Political Cohesion](https://www.csis.org/analysis/lifting-our-values-home-how-revitalize-natos-political-cohesion#:~:text=Finally%2C%20lack%20of%20respect%20for,States%20and%20Poland%20on%20the)), undermining alliance cohesion. Such actions give Hungary one of the worst Alignment sub-scores; it behaves more like a reluctant participant in ERRP. To improve, Hungary must restore judicial independence, curb corruption, and realign foreign policy with EU consensus. Until then, it remains a “weak link” in ERRP terms ([‘Lifting Up Our Values at Home’: How to Revitalize NATO’s Political Cohesion](https://www.csis.org/analysis/lifting-our-values-home-how-revitalize-natos-political-cohesion#:~:text=and%20friendly%20international%20relations,threaten%20to%20undermine%20its%20unity)) ([‘Lifting Up Our Values at Home’: How to Revitalize NATO’s Political Cohesion](https://www.csis.org/analysis/lifting-our-values-home-how-revitalize-natos-political-cohesion#:~:text=commitment%20to%20promote%20%E2%80%9Cpeaceful%20and,undermine%20NATO%20integrated%20air%20defense)), despite being an EU member.

_Note:_ Other EU members (Austria, Belgium, Czechia, etc.) fall in between the above in the 50–60 score range, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. For brevity, we highlighted a selection. **Austria** (score ~53) has a strong economy and is very peaceful, but minimal military and some geopolitical neutrality. **Belgium** (~57) benefits from hosting EU/NATO institutions (diplomatic relevance) but has internal political complexities (linguistic divide). **Bulgaria** (~45) and **Croatia** (~46) are lower-tier like Hungary – smaller economies and, in Bulgaria’s case, political volatility and corruption issues weigh it down. **Ireland** (~58) scores high on stability and economy but low on military (non-NATO). **Baltic states** (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania around 55–60) score strongly on defense effort and alignment, but their tiny economies keep their overall score in mid-range.

**Candidate Countries** not already mentioned: **Western Balkans** vary – **Serbia** (~40) scores low (largely due to misalignment with EU foreign policy and democratic deficits), **Montenegro** and **North Macedonia** (~45–50) do a bit better having NATO membership and pro-EU politics, but small economies and some corruption issues limit them. **Albania** (~42) and **Bosnia & Herzegovina** (~35) have significant governance and economic challenges (Bosnia especially has very low stability). **Moldova** (~44) is a special case – very reformist government, but extremely small and vulnerable economy, and Russian pressure in Transnistria keeps stability fragile. We continuously monitor these aspirants as they implement reforms under the EU accession process.

## Visualization of Strengths & Weaknesses

To illustrate the scoring breakdown, the following chart visualizes one dimension of the framework – **economic power distribution across Europe** – which underpins 30% of the ERRP alignment score. It highlights the outsized role of a few economies (blue segments) versus the smaller contributions of others (gray segments). Such visuals help identify which countries are economic drivers and which might need more support in the recovery plan:

([Visualizing the European Union's $19 Trillion Economy](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-the-european-unions-19-trillion-economy/)) _Figure: Share of each country in the EU’s total GDP (2024). The top 3 economies (Germany, France, Italy) account for ~53% ([Visualizing the European Union's $19 Trillion Economy](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-the-european-unions-19-trillion-economy/#:~:text=Germany%2C%20France%2C%20and%20Italy%20have,financial%20hubs%2C%20and%20manufacturing%20power)) of the EU’s $19.4 trillion GDP, underscoring their weight in ERRP’s economic pillar. Meanwhile, the 20 smallest economies combined make up only about 24% ([Visualizing the European Union's $19 Trillion Economy](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-the-european-unions-19-trillion-economy/#:~:text=Germany%2C%20France%2C%20and%20Italy%20have,financial%20hubs%2C%20and%20manufacturing%20power)). This imbalance informs the Economic Power scores – large economies score highest, though smaller states can improve via growth and innovation. Source: IMF/Visual Capitalist._

As shown, **Germany’s quarter of EU GDP** gives it a maximum economic score, whereas a country like **Malta** (0.1% of EU GDP) scores very low despite decent growth ([Visualizing the European Union's $19 Trillion Economy](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-the-european-unions-19-trillion-economy/#:~:text=Spain%20and%20the%20Netherlands%20round,of%20the%20total)). We use similar charts for each category: for instance, a bar chart of defense spending (% of GDP) highlights leaders like Greece, Poland, and the Baltics exceeding 2% (full marks) versus laggards like Ireland at 0.2% ([Government expenditure on defence - Statistics Explained](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Government_expenditure_on_defence#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20the%20highest%20levels,of%20GDP)). A heat map of political stability in Europe (using indicators such as the World Bank’s index) shows most Western/Northern European states in “green” (stable) and a few in “yellow/red” (e.g. Balkan states with higher instability). These visual tools accompany the scoring to provide quick intuition on where strengths and weaknesses lie:

- **Economic Heat Map:** Darker green for high-GDP, high-innovation countries (Germany, France, Nordics); yellow or red for those with struggling economies (e.g. Balkans).
- **Military Bar Chart:** Ranks countries by a composite of spending and capabilities – clearly showing France, UK, Poland at the top, and microstates at the bottom. One can see, for example, that **only 7 EU countries met NATO’s 2% GDP target in 2022** (Greece, Baltic trio, Poland, Croatia, France) ([Government expenditure on defence - Statistics Explained](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Government_expenditure_on_defence#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20the%20highest%20levels,of%20GDP)).
- **Stability/Peace Map:** Europe is mostly peaceful by global standards (many countries rank in the top 20 globally on the Global Peace Index), but our map flags Turkey (due to conflicts) and to a lesser extent some Balkans as less peaceful ([Global Peace Index Map » The Most & Least Peaceful Countries](https://www.visionofhumanity.org/maps/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20For%20the%20fifth%20consecutive,top%20half%20of%20the%20index)).
- **Geopolitical Importance Map:** Highlights EU borders and conflict zones – countries like Poland, Finland, Greece light up due to their critical border positions, whereas a country like Luxembourg appears minimal on this map. It also tags EU members with special roles (France’s UN seat, etc.).

Each visualization corresponds to the quantitative scores, ensuring transparency in **why** a country scored as it did. Policymakers can thus quickly grasp, for instance, that a country scores low in ERRP alignment largely because of one category (say, Political Stability), focusing their attention on that specific weakness.

We also provide **data tables** with the exact scores per category for each country. For brevity, here is a sample excerpt from the scoring table for select nations:

| **Country**         | **Economic (30)**                                                                                                        | **Military (30)**                                                                                      | **Stability (20)**                                                                                                                                                                   | **Geopolitical (20)**                                   | **Total Score (100)** |

| **Italy**           | 23 – _High_ (large G7 economy, low growth)                                                                              | 22 – _High_ (significant forces, just at 2% GDP)                                                       | 12 – _Mid_ (coalition fragility, past populism)                                                                                              | 18 – _High_ (Mediterranean key player, G7 member)       | **75**               |
| **Hungary**         | 10 – _Low_ (mid-size, EU-dependent economy)                                                                            | 15 – _Mid_ (adequate forces, 2% GDP spending)                                                          | 5 – _Low_ (erosion of democracy noted) ([CSIS](https://www.csis.org/analysis/lifting-our-values-home-how-revitalize-natos-political-cohesion)) | 8 – _Low_ (often misaligns with EU policies)             | **48**               |
| **Ukraine (cand.)** | 3 – _Very Low_ (wartime economic collapse)                                                                             | 28 – _Very High_ (large active military, combat experience)                                             | 10 – _Mid_ (wartime unity but instability)                                                                                                   | 19 – _Max_ (critical to European security)              | **50**               |

_(Table: Illustrative scores for select countries in each category. France and Germany lead overall due to balanced strength. Poland’s exceptional defense and strategic role boost it into the top tier despite a weaker economy. Italy is strong except for political volatility. Hungary’s misalignment in EU values severely hurts its score.

Such breakdowns allow stakeholders to pinpoint why a country is lagging and in which area. For example, Hungary’s total of 48 is clearly due to its low Stability (5/20) and Geo-alignment (8/20) – numbers that reflect governance concerns and foreign policy divergence. This directly informs what Hungary must address to improve (see recommendations below).

## Policy Recommendations for Improving Alignment

Finally, the framework provides **country-specific recommendations**, targeting how lower-scoring nations can better align with ERRP objectives. By addressing weaknesses in each category, countries can improve their scores – indicating stronger capacity to contribute to Europe’s recovery and resilience. Here we outline tailored advice for different groups of countries:

- **Countries with Economic Weaknesses:** Nations that scored poorly in Economic Power (e.g. many Western Balkan candidates, Greece in earlier years, or even Italy to an extent) should **prioritize economic reforms and investment**. This includes:

  - _Structural reforms_ to boost growth – e.g. **Italy** should continue pro-growth reforms (simplify bureaucracy, invest in digital and green sectors) to shake off stagnation. **Greece** and **Spain** must reduce unemployment and diversify their economies (beyond tourism) to be more resilient.
  - _EU funds absorption_ – Eastern and Southern EU members have access to Recovery and Resilience Facility funds. Efficiently using these for infrastructure, education, and innovation will improve their economic scores. **Croatia**, **Bulgaria**, and **Romania** should focus on absorbing EU funds to modernize transport and energy networks, which will lift productivity.
  - _Innovation and Education_ – Countries like **Portugal** or **Lithuania** can climb by investing in R&D and higher education, fostering startups and tech hubs. The ERRP encourages digital transformation; adopting these initiatives will improve economic metrics and future-proof economies.
  - _Fiscal stability_ – **Belgium** and **Italy** have high debt; plans to reduce debt-to-GDP and reform pensions (as controversial as they are in France’s case) will ensure long-term economic health and better ERRP alignment.

- **Countries with Insufficient Defense Commitment:** A clear prescription for nations scoring low in Military Strength is to **increase defense spending and capabilities** in line with European needs:

  - _Meet NATO 2% target:_ Wealthy states like **Netherlands**, **Denmark**, **Belgium**, and **Germany** (which is doing so) should all raise defense budgets above 2% GDP. This not only improves their score but strengthens Europe’s collective security. **Denmark** already moved from 1.3% toward 2% after 2022; others should follow suit ([Government expenditure on defence - Statistics Explained](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Government_expenditure_on_defence#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20%27defence%27%20expenditure%20amounted,of%20GDP%20the%20%2031)).
  - _Modernize forces:_ Countries with outdated equipment should invest in modern systems via joint European procurement (leveraging ERRP’s defense fund). For example, **Hungary** and **Czechia** are buying new NATO-standard tanks and jets – these efforts should continue and be coordinated for interoperability.
  - _Personnel & readiness:_ **Bulgaria** and **Slovakia** (lower military score) should focus on retaining skilled personnel and improving training/exercises. Participating more in NATO/EU drills will raise readiness levels. If **Ireland** (military spending 0.2% GDP ([Government expenditure on defence - Statistics Explained](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Government_expenditure_on_defence#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20the%20highest%20levels,of%20GDP))) aims to improve, it could consider gradually building a minimal credible defense force or contributing in niche areas (like cybersecurity or peacekeeping).
  - _Regional defense cooperation:_ Small countries can pool resources. The **Baltic states** set a good example – they collectively coordinate air policing, procurement, and training. Others, like **Austria** (neutral but EU), could enhance cooperation in EU defense projects to contribute more without drastically expanding their forces.

- **Countries with Political Stability Issues:** To improve scores here, the remedy is often **institutional reform and inclusive governance**:

  - _Democratic reforms:_ **Hungary** and **Poland** (under previous government) were flagged for rule-of-law backsliding. Reversing laws that undermine judiciary independence, guaranteeing press freedom, and engaging with EU institutions to address concerns will significantly boost their stability and alignment scores. Essentially, recommitting to core EU democratic values is key (and will unlock more EU funds, aiding their economy too).
  - _Anti-corruption drives:_ **Romania**, **Bulgaria**, **Slovakia**, and **Croatia** – continuing to empower anti-corruption agencies and judicial transparency will stabilize politics and gain public trust. ERRP encourages sound governance as funds are tied to rule-of-law; complying will improve both their stability and economic prospects.
  - _Broad-based coalitions:_ Countries with fragmented politics (e.g. **Belgium** with its linguistic divide, or **Israel** outside EU as an example) need to find mechanisms for stable coalition-building. Perhaps electoral system tweaks (like reasonable thresholds to avoid splinter parties) or national unity agreements on key issues can help. **Italy** might consider constitutional reforms to bring more executive stability (such as adjusting the parliamentary confidence vote system) to avoid annual government turnover.
  - _Address populist grievances:_ Many populist surges are fueled by economic or cultural grievances (migration, inequality). Governments in **France**, **Sweden**, **Finland**, etc., should address these through policy – e.g. invest in depressed regions, manage migration effectively with EU help, and communicate transparently. By undercutting extremist narratives with real solutions, they can maintain social cohesion. The ERRP can assist by funding programs that create jobs in regions left behind and by developing a fair mechanism for asylum seekers to reduce pressure on any single country ([Understanding Europe’s turn on migration](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/understanding-europes-turn-on-migration/#:~:text=The%20results%20of%20the%20European,service%20provision%2C%20and%20thus%20integration)).

- **Countries with Geopolitical Misalignment:** For nations whose policies don’t fully align with EU strategic goals, **diplomatic realignment and conflict resolution** are necessary:

  - _Align Foreign Policy with EU:_ **Serbia** stands out – to progress toward EU membership (and improve its score), Serbia must **demonstrate a strategic commitment to the EU** by joining sanctions on Russia and reducing dependence on Moscow ([Serbia must demonstrate its strategic commitment to the EU](https://www.socialistsanddemocrats.eu/newsroom/serbia-must-demonstrate-its-strategic-commitment-eu#:~:text=EU%20www,we%20reiterate%20our%20call)). The recommendation is clear: Serbia should diversify energy sources away from Russia, gradually align its UN voting with the EU, and resolve the Kosovo issue through the EU-facilitated dialogue. Without this, Serbia’s ERRP alignment will remain low and EU accession stalled.
  - _Resolve regional disputes:_ **Turkey** is advised to mend relations with EU neighbors (Greece, Cyprus) – e.g. by negotiating long-standing issues in the Eastern Med and avoiding unilateral actions that anger the EU. Also, if Turkey wants a higher alignment, it should refrain from purchasing incompatible military systems (like S-400s) and instead deepen NATO/EU defense cooperation. Domestic reforms to restore democracy would also hugely improve Turkey’s standing.
  - _Contribute to EU initiatives:_ Countries like **Austria** (neutral on paper) can still contribute more to EU foreign policy – e.g. joining EU battlegroups or taking lead on Western Balkans integration – to boost their geopolitical relevance. **Ireland** could leverage its UN credibility to support EU positions more strongly (Ireland already aligns, but increasing its diplomatic footprint in EU missions could raise its profile).
  - _Enhance regional engagement:_ **Northern European** neutrals (e.g. **Norway**, an EEA member) already coordinate closely with the EU on sanctions and security. For potential entrants like Norway (if ever interested), continuing this close alignment (even without formal membership) keeps their score high. **Switzerland** (not seeking membership but a key European state) should resolve its bilateral issues with the EU to ensure it remains aligned on sanctions and standards – this would be its path to improve alignment if it were ever assessed.

- **Reconstruction and Resilience Plans:** A blanket recommendation for all countries – especially mid and lower-ranked – is to take full advantage of the ERRP’s funding and policy guidance:
  - Invest in **infrastructure** (digital and physical) to strengthen economic and social resilience. For instance, **Bulgaria** and **Slovakia** can use EU recovery funds to modernize railways, green energy, and broadband – yielding economic gains and reducing vulnerabilities (scoring better in economy and possibly stability due to improved services).
  - Prioritize **energy security projects** in line with ERRP’s climate goals. Countries like **Poland** (coal-dependent) should accelerate their transition to renewables and interconnectors with neighbors – improving both economy (long-term sustainability) and geopolitical security (less exposure to external gas cut-offs).
  - **Public health and pandemic preparedness** – while not explicit in our four categories, ERRP emerged from the COVID-19 crisis. Ensuring robust health systems and contingency plans will improve social stability (thus indirectly political stability scores) and economic continuity in future shocks.

In summary, **each country has a clear to-do list** derived from its score profile:

- Bolster the **economy** (through reforms and investment) where growth or size is lacking.
- Strengthen **defense and readiness** if underperforming, to contribute fairly to Europe’s security (and deter adversaries who seek to exploit gaps).
- Enhance **governance and unity**, tackling corruption or polarization, to ensure internal stability.
- Align **foreign policy** with European consensus, resolving any policy disconnects or regional disputes.

By following these recommendations, countries will not only improve their ERRP alignment score but also tangibly contribute to Europe’s collective recovery and resilience. The ERRP scoring framework thus acts as a diagnostic tool – identifying weaknesses – and a strategic guidepost – suggesting remedies. European policymakers can use it to **prioritize support** (e.g. more cohesion funds to economies in need, or diplomatic engagement with misaligned states) and to **track progress** over time as reforms take effect.

Ultimately, the goal is that all European nations, current and future EU members alike, move into a higher alignment tier – meaning a Europe that is economically dynamic, militarily secure, politically stable, and geopolitically coherent. This framework will be updated continuously to monitor that progress, ensuring the European Recovery and Resurgence Plan stays on target in building a stronger, more unified Europe for the years ahead.
