# Introduction

Europe’s quest for strategic autonomy has given rise to a “European Resurgence Plan” aiming to strengthen the EU’s military, economic, and diplomatic independence. This plan envisions a Europe capable of defending itself without relying on NATO, sustaining its economy without external dependencies, and negotiating as a great power in a multipolar world. Achieving these ambitions requires careful validation against historical precedents and scholarly analysis. Past attempts at European unification in defense, lessons from great-power dynamics, and current international relations theories all inform what is feasible. This paper evaluates the plan’s proposals in four dimensions – military, economic, diplomatic, and strategic leverage – grounding each in academic research and historical experience. The analysis refines the plan where necessary to ensure its recommendations are realistic and supported by evidence, ultimately strengthening the plan’s legitimacy and practical application as a blueprint for Europe’s future.

## Military Feasibility

**Building an Independent European Defense:** The plan’s call for an independent European military force (sometimes envisioned as a “European Army”) reflects long-standing debates over European strategic autonomy. In principle, Europe’s combined defense spending (over €200 billion annually) rivals that of global powers, but these resources remain fragmented across nations ([What European NATO Lacks - CEPA](https://cepa.org/article/what-european-nato-lacks/#:~:text=The%20European%20Union%20,security%20and%20support%20for%20Ukraine)) ([How would Europe defend itself? - Defense Priorities](https://www.defensepriorities.org/explainers/how-would-europe-defend-itself/#:~:text=role%20in%20NATO%20regardless%20of,be%20an%20important%20test%20case)). Scholars note that Europe is still **“heavily dependent on American support”** for critical military enablers ([What European NATO Lacks - CEPA](https://cepa.org/article/what-european-nato-lacks/#:~:text=Europe%E2%80%99s%20security%20is%20still%20heavily,what%20happens%20if%20that%20vanishes)). NATO assessments confirm that European militaries lack key **“strategic capabilities”** such as command-and-control systems, strategic airlift, intelligence/surveillance assets, and integrated missile defense that the U.S. routinely provides ([What European NATO Lacks - CEPA](https://cepa.org/article/what-european-nato-lacks/#:~:text=these%2C%20European%20forces%20would%20struggle,sustain%20operations%20on%20their%20own)). Without these force multipliers, purely European forces would struggle to **“sustain operations on their own” ([What European NATO Lacks - CEPA](https://cepa.org/article/what-european-nato-lacks/#:~:text=Europe%E2%80%99s%20most%20significant%20defense%20shortfalls,sustain%20operations%20on%20their%20own))**. Furthermore, NATO’s top operational commands are all U.S.-led, and experts warn NATO would have extreme difficulty functioning without U.S. commanders and staff ([What European NATO Lacks - CEPA](https://cepa.org/article/what-european-nato-lacks/#:~:text=Another%20key%20challenge%20is%20operational,all%20led%20by%20US%20officers)) ([What European NATO Lacks - CEPA](https://cepa.org/article/what-european-nato-lacks/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20don%E2%80%99t%20think%20that%20NATO,be%20extremely%20difficult%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Davis)). These realities indicate that while Europe can enhance its autonomous defense capacity, creating a fully independent deterrent force is a long-term project. Significant **spending increases** and capability investments would be required to actualize an independent European force ([How would Europe defend itself? - Defense Priorities](https://www.defensepriorities.org/explainers/how-would-europe-defend-itself/#:~:text=role%20in%20NATO%20regardless%20of,be%20an%20important%20test%20case)). Indeed, many EU members until recently failed to meet even NATO’s basic 2% GDP defense spending goal ([How would Europe defend itself? - Defense Priorities](https://www.defensepriorities.org/explainers/how-would-europe-defend-itself/#:~:text=should%20not%20be%20construed%20as,to%20achieve%20full%20defensive%20autonomy)). Closing this gap is feasible – Europe’s economic weight could support a larger military – but it will not be quick or easy ([How would Europe defend itself? - Defense Priorities](https://www.defensepriorities.org/explainers/how-would-europe-defend-itself/#:~:text=Key%20points)). A RAND study concludes that true autonomy would demand not only money but overcoming political divisions and coordinating dozens of separate militaries, a daunting task ([What European NATO Lacks - CEPA](https://cepa.org/article/what-european-nato-lacks/#:~:text=The%20European%20Union%20,security%20and%20support%20for%20Ukraine)). In practice, adapting NATO’s existing structures (by strengthening a **“European pillar”** within NATO) is seen by some analysts as the most realistic path in the near term ([How would Europe defend itself? - Defense Priorities](https://www.defensepriorities.org/explainers/how-would-europe-defend-itself/#:~:text=1,basic%20funding%20obligations%2C%20significant%20spending)). This approach would let Europe assume greater responsibility **“with less America”**, as one plan suggests, through a decade-long effort to boost European capabilities while still benefitting from NATO frameworks ([Defending Europe with less America | ECFR](https://ecfr.eu/publication/defending-europe-with-less-america/#:~:text=Defending%20Europe%20with%20less%20America,defend%20Europe%20with%20less%20America)). Historical precedent supports incremental integration: the failed European Defence Community of the 1950s showed the difficulty of a sudden leap to a supranational army, whereas gradual initiatives (Eurocorps, joint brigades, and today’s PESCO programs) have achieved modest military integration by building trust over time. In summary, Europe _can_ build a more unified and capable military force, but academic assessments urge caution about timeline and scope – it is a medium-to-long term feasibility, requiring sustained commitment rather than an overnight transformation.

**Lessons from Past Military Unification:** History offers both inspiration and caution for Europe’s military unification. In the early 1950s, six nations negotiated a Treaty for a European Defence Community (EDC) that would have created a combined European army. This ambitious plan failed in 1954 when the French Parliament refused to ratify it, fearing loss of sovereignty and insufficient UK/US involvement ([Treaty establishing the European Defence Community - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_establishing_the_European_Defence_Community#:~:text=Treaty%20establishing%20the%20European%20Defence,establishing%20the%20European%20Defence)) ([Revisiting the failure of the “European army” (1950–1954) - Cairn](https://shs.cairn.info/journal-les-champs-de-mars-2018-1-page-47?lang=en#:~:text=Revisiting%20the%20failure%20of%20the,that%20focus%20on%20the)). The EDC’s collapse underscored that successful military integration needs strong political buy-in and a clear external threat. By contrast, NATO, while not a European-only project, has been a durable model of multi-national defense integration – European allies pooled capabilities under a unified command (albeit U.S.-led) which deterred the Soviet threat for decades. Another example is the gradual unification of German states’ militaries in the 19th century under Prussian leadership, which created a powerful German Empire; this suggests that when political unity is achieved, military unification can swiftly follow. For the EU, recent initiatives like the EU Battlegroups (small joint forces) and the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence indicate steps toward integration, but these remain limited in scale. The literature stresses that **piecemeal integration successes** – joint procurement, shared command centers, and integrated units – can build confidence ([What European NATO Lacks - CEPA](https://cepa.org/article/what-european-nato-lacks/#:~:text=The%20European%20Union%20,security%20and%20support%20for%20Ukraine)). Europe’s _Strategic Compass 2030_ plans to create a 5,000-strong rapid deployment force under EU command, a far cry from NATO’s vast structure but a symbolic step. Overall, historical precedents imply that a **“European Army”** is not unprecedented conceptually, but its realization depends on resolving sovereignty concerns and demonstrating clear added value to each member state’s security. Without the unifying pressure of an existential threat, the EU must rely on political will and trust – commodities that are growing in the wake of recent crises but still uneven. Thus, the Resurgence Plan’s military dimension should be adjusted to pursue steady integration (e.g. expanding joint units, common defense industries, and EU command capabilities) rather than an abrupt creation of a single army. This calibrated approach aligns with scholarly advice to strengthen Europe’s defense **“one achievement at a time”** through coordinated investments ([A European defence industrial strategy in a hostile world - Bruegel](https://www.bruegel.org/policy-brief/european-defence-industrial-strategy-hostile-world#:~:text=A%20European%20defence%20industrial%20strategy,We%20conclude%20with%20policy%20recommendations)).

**Role of Nuclear Deterrence:** Incorporating nuclear deterrence into a European defense framework is one of the most sensitive yet crucial issues. Currently, only two European states – France and the UK – possess nuclear weapons, and the UK is no longer in the EU. France maintains an independent force of about 300 warheads and has traditionally seen its **force de frappe** as a strictly national insurance of sovereignty ([France Offers Nuclear Deterrent to All Europe | Arms Control Association](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2020-03/news/france-offers-nuclear-deterrent-all-europe#:~:text=security%20of%20Europe%20through%20their,said%20before%20extending%20the%20offer)) ([France Offers Nuclear Deterrent to All Europe | Arms Control Association](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2020-03/news/france-offers-nuclear-deterrent-all-europe#:~:text=%E2%80%9CFrance%E2%80%99s%20nuclear%20doctrine%20strictly%20adheres,nuclear%20weapons%20in%20its%20arsenal)). However, French leaders have increasingly acknowledged a “European dimension” to their nuclear forces. In 2020 President Emmanuel Macron stated that France’s nuclear arsenal **“strengthens the security of Europe through its very existence,”** inviting dialogue on how French deterrence could protect Europe collectively ([France Offers Nuclear Deterrent to All Europe | Arms Control Association](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2020-03/news/france-offers-nuclear-deterrent-all-europe#:~:text=French%20President%20Emmanuel%20Macron%20offered,play%20in%20their%20collective%20security)). Some have proposed a **“Eurodeterrent”** – essentially Europeanizing France’s (and potentially the UK’s) nuclear umbrella for EU benefit ([Why Macron is offering France's nukes to Europe | The Spectator](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/why-macron-is-offering-frances-nukes-to-europe/#:~:text=Why%20Macron%20is%20offering%20France%27s,is%20just%20one%20of)). Macron even offered to discuss **“the role that France’s nuclear deterrent can play in [Europe’s] collective security,”** hinting at a willingness to extend protection or involve other EU states in planning ([France Offers Nuclear Deterrent to All Europe | Arms Control Association](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2020-03/news/france-offers-nuclear-deterrent-all-europe#:~:text=French%20President%20Emmanuel%20Macron%20offered,play%20in%20their%20collective%20security)). Nonetheless, scholarly and legal analyses underscore serious constraints. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) forbids nuclear weapon states from transferring nuclear weapons or control to any recipient, including alliances or EU entities ([](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_3605227_1/component/file_3605228/content#:~:text=whether%20Europe%20itself%20should%20have,Luxembourg%20founded%20the%20European%20Atomic)) ([](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_3605227_1/component/file_3605228/content#:~:text=such%20under%20a%20nuclear%20umbrella,the%20EU%20or%20some%20European)). Unlike the U.S. nuclear sharing arrangement in NATO (which places American nuclear bombs in Europe under U.S. final control), a truly EU-controlled warhead would breach NPT obligations ([](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_3605227_1/component/file_3605228/content#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20options%3F%20There,of%20the%20French%20arsenal%20would)) ([](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_3605227_1/component/file_3605228/content#:~:text=The%20idea%20of%20shared%20European,Soviet%20Union%20and%20the%20UK)). France’s capacity to “share” its weapons is thus limited by treaty – Paris cannot simply hand over warheads or the launch codes to an EU committee ([](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_3605227_1/component/file_3605228/content#:~:text=whether%20Europe%20itself%20should%20have,Luxembourg%20founded%20the%20European%20Atomic)). One feasible avenue, noted by analysts, is a **French nuclear umbrella for Europe**: France could politically declare that any attack on Europe might trigger its nuclear response, effectively extending deterrence coverage ([](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_3605227_1/component/file_3605228/content#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20options%3F%20There,of%20the%20French%20arsenal%20would)). To bolster credibility, other European states might financially contribute to France’s arsenal modernization or even co-decide on doctrine (a sensitive proposition France has so far been ambivalent about) ([Full article: Forum: Towards a European Nuclear Deterrent](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00396338.2024.2403218#:~:text=Deterrent%20www,weapons%2C%20which%20German%20Finance)) ([Forum: Towards a European Nuclear Deterrent](https://www.iiss.org/online-analysis/survival-online/2024/09/forum-towards-a-european-nuclear-deterrent/#:~:text=,with%20either%20the%20EU)). Another idea floated in German debate is for Germany, Italy, or others to co-finance an expansion of the French arsenal in exchange for a form of joint control – but again, legal and political hurdles abound ([](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_3605227_1/component/file_3605228/content#:~:text=members,A%20second)). Besides France, the UK’s Trident force remains committed to NATO defense; closer UK-EU defense cooperation post-Brexit could in theory give Europe an added layer of deterrence (if political relations improve). The Resurgence Plan should therefore include nuclear deterrence _as part of its defense calculus_, but realistically via existing national forces. A consensus in the literature is that **France’s nuclear weapons cannot simply “replace” the U.S. nuclear umbrella overnight** ([Europe targets homegrown nuclear deterrent as Trump ... - Politico.EU](https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-nuclear-weapons-nato-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-friedrich-merz/#:~:text=Europe%20targets%20homegrown%20nuclear%20deterrent,Transatlantic%20relations%20War%20in%20Ukraine)). However, they provide a minimal independent deterrent that could discourage major threats in Europe ([Why Macron is offering France's nukes to Europe | The Spectator](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/why-macron-is-offering-frances-nukes-to-europe/#:~:text=Why%20Macron%20is%20offering%20France%27s,is%20just%20one%20of)). The plan should support ongoing dialogues (like Macron’s initiative) to **“Europeanize” French deterrence** through transparency and perhaps involving EU partners in exercises or planning ([France Offers Nuclear Deterrent to All Europe | Arms Control Association](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2020-03/news/france-offers-nuclear-deterrent-all-europe#:~:text=security%20of%20Europe%20through%20their,said%20before%20extending%20the%20offer)). Additionally, Europe can strengthen conventional deterrence to raise the threshold before nuclear options are considered. In sum, a European defense framework can rely on France (and the UK via NATO) for nuclear backstop, while rejecting any new proliferation. Academic analyses find that pursuing a separate EU nuclear capability would not only violate international law but also be strategically unnecessary if France’s arsenal is credibly integrated into European defense ([](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_3605227_1/component/file_3605228/content#:~:text=However%2C%20given%20the%20progress%20in,Community%20is%20to%20promote%20the)) ([](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_3605227_1/component/file_3605228/content#:~:text=such%20under%20a%20nuclear%20umbrella,the%20EU%20or%20some%20European)). Thus, the Plan’s legitimacy is bolstered by clarifying that Europe’s nuclear deterrent rests on existing forces used in a European interest context, rather than a risky bid to create EU-controlled warheads.

**Replacing U.S. Bases and Assets:** A bold proposal of the plan is to replace U.S. military bases in Europe with European alternatives, ensuring Europe can project power and host forces on its own. U.S. bases in Europe (such as Ramstein Air Base in Germany or Aviano in Italy) currently serve as critical hubs for logistics, intelligence, and rapid deployment. Could Europe fill this void? Physically, the infrastructure (airfields, ports, training ranges) is on European soil and could be nationalized or transitioned to EU/NATO command if the U.S. withdrew. The real challenge is replicating the capabilities that those bases enable. For example, Ramstein houses sophisticated command, control, and communications systems and serves as a node for satellite links and drone operations. Europeans would need to invest in comparable **“strategic enablers”**, which, as noted, are presently limited ([What European NATO Lacks - CEPA](https://cepa.org/article/what-european-nato-lacks/#:~:text=these%2C%20European%20forces%20would%20struggle,sustain%20operations%20on%20their%20own)). Similarly, U.S. bases host units for air defense, logistics, and medical support that Europe would have to raise itself. In terms of nuclear assets, U.S. bases also currently store American B61 nuclear bombs in five European countries under NATO nuclear-sharing. Replacing those with European nuclear assets would require either expanding French warhead deployments or developing new weapons – the latter is not viable for legal/political reasons as discussed. A more attainable scenario is that if U.S. nuclear bombs were removed, Europe would rely entirely on French (and British) nuclear forces for deterrence, possibly increasing their alert posture or dispersal within Europe if needed (with French consent). This is conceivable: France could choose to deploy some nuclear-capable aircraft or submarines in a way that signals coverage of Eastern Europe, for instance, if U.S. assets were gone. However, most scholars see **maintaining some U.S. presence in Europe in the short-to-medium term as beneficial** even for a Europe pursuing autonomy ([How would Europe defend itself? - Defense Priorities](https://www.defensepriorities.org/explainers/how-would-europe-defend-itself/#:~:text=1,basic%20funding%20obligations%2C%20significant%20spending)). The reason is that a sudden gap in capabilities or credibility could invite aggression before Europe’s replacements are ready. A **phased approach** is advised: as European forces gain strength, U.S. bases could gradually shift to a supportive or symbolic role. There are precedents for major power transitions – e.g., British military bases east of Suez were handed over as the UK withdrew in the 1960s, and local forces or allies stepped in. If Europe proceeds methodically, replacing U.S. assets piece by piece (for example, first developing its own airlift fleet to reduce reliance on U.S. transports, then building ISR satellites to replace American intel), it can minimize security gaps. The feasibility is there: Europe has world-class defense industries and technological know-how to produce transport aircraft, satellites, missile defenses, etc. Indeed, the EU’s new defense fund and PESCO projects aim to jointly develop such capacities. The key constraint is _political and temporal_ – it will take years of coordinated effort and substantial funding. For now, plans like **“Defending Europe with Less America”** propose a 10-year timeline of investments so that by the 2030s Europe could handle a regional conflict largely on its own ([Defending Europe with less America | ECFR](https://ecfr.eu/publication/defending-europe-with-less-america/#:~:text=Defending%20Europe%20with%20less%20America,defend%20Europe%20with%20less%20America)). In refining the plan, it should be explicit that U.S. bases would only be fully replaced once equivalent European command centers, training missions, and rapid reaction logistics are in place. Until then, Europe can increase its autonomy by **hosting its own multinational forces on European bases alongside U.S. troops**, gradually reducing reliance. This nuanced position is supported by defense experts who argue for **“greater European defensive autonomy”** while acknowledging it cannot be achieved overnight without risking deterrence ([How would Europe defend itself? - Defense Priorities](https://www.defensepriorities.org/explainers/how-would-europe-defend-itself/#:~:text=Key%20points)) ([How would Europe defend itself? - Defense Priorities](https://www.defensepriorities.org/explainers/how-would-europe-defend-itself/#:~:text=the%20regional%20level%2C%20as%20opposed,a%20more%20robust%20threat%20to)).

In conclusion, the military dimension of the European Resurgence Plan is viable if pursued in a staged and evidence-based manner. Europe can credibly enhance its deterrence by increasing defense integration, but it must address current shortfalls in high-end capabilities and consider the nuclear question realistically. Peer-reviewed research and defense assessments counsel against an abrupt break from NATO; instead, Europe should build a strong autonomous pillar within NATO now (for immediate security) while laying the groundwork for fuller independence in the future ([How would Europe defend itself? - Defense Priorities](https://www.defensepriorities.org/explainers/how-would-europe-defend-itself/#:~:text=1,basic%20funding%20obligations%2C%20significant%20spending)). Historical failures like the EDC show that political unity is the linchpin – encouragingly, today’s public opinion in Europe is more favorable to EU defense cooperation, partly due to shared threats. By learning from past integration efforts and coordinating closely with existing alliances, Europe can create a military force capable of deterring threats largely on its own. The end-state would be a Europe that contributes the majority of forces and capabilities for its defense, relying on transatlantic help only as a bonus, not a necessity. Such strategic autonomy in defense, properly implemented, would mark a successful realization of the plan’s core intent.

## Economic Sustainability

**Energy Independence and Alternative Sourcing:** Europe’s drive for energy independence has become a central economic-security objective, especially after the Russia-Ukraine war exposed Europe’s vulnerabilities. In 2021, the EU produced only **44% of its own energy** and had to import 56% ([Shedding light on energy in the EU – 2023 edition - Interactive publications - Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/interactive-publications/energy-2023#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20the%20EU%20produced,was%20imported)) – a clear sign of dependency on external suppliers for oil, gas, and coal. Russia’s share was particularly problematic: before 2022, over 40% of Europe’s imported natural gas came from Russia, with some EU states more than 80% dependent ([Europe’s messy Russian gas divorce](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/europes-messy-russian-gas-divorce/#:~:text=Before%20the%20invasion%2C%20more%20than,But%20Germany%20was)). This reliance allowed Russia to wield energy as geopolitical leverage. The war catalyzed a dramatic shift. By the end of 2023, Russian gas had been slashed to about **15% of Europe’s gas supply** (down from nearly half in early 2021) ([Europe’s messy Russian gas divorce](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/europes-messy-russian-gas-divorce/#:~:text=Europe%20still%20imported%2014.8,Europe%E2%80%99s%20total%20gas%20supply%20came)) ([Europe’s messy Russian gas divorce](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/europes-messy-russian-gas-divorce/#:~:text=By%20late%20September%2C%20Russian%20supply,TurkStream%20pipeline%2C%20but%20the%20Nord)). Europe scrambled to secure alternative sources – importing record volumes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States, Qatar, and others, and maximizing pipeline gas from Norway and North Africa. In fact, Europe added **53.5 billion cubic meters of LNG import capacity** in 2022-23 alone (through new terminals and floating storage/regasification units) ([Europe’s messy Russian gas divorce](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/europes-messy-russian-gas-divorce/#:~:text=war%20in%20Ukraine%2C%20Europe%20has,natural%20gas%20consumption%2C%20respectively%2C%20up)). As a result, LNG rose to 34–37% of EU gas consumption in 2022-2023, versus only ~4% a few years prior ([Europe’s messy Russian gas divorce](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/europes-messy-russian-gas-divorce/#:~:text=war%20in%20Ukraine%2C%20Europe%20has,natural%20gas%20consumption%2C%20respectively%2C%20up)). This diversification underscores the _feasibility_ of reducing reliance on a single supplier. However, true “independence” in energy means not just switching suppliers but minimizing imports overall. Here, Europe’s climate and energy strategy comes into play. The EU has committed to a massive expansion of renewable energy and improved efficiency under initiatives like the Green Deal and REPowerEU. By 2024, renewables accounted for an estimated **24% of the EU’s final energy use** (up from 20% in 2020) ([Renewable energy | European Environment Agency's home page](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/topics/in-depth/renewable-energy#:~:text=energy%20system%20have%20decreased%20steadily,European%20Union%E2%80%99s%20final%20energy%20use)). Wind and solar capacity are growing rapidly (EU countries invested around **€110 billion in renewable projects in 2023 alone**). Nuclear energy, which provides about 25% of EU electricity, is another domestic source Europe is leveraging (with some countries building new reactors and others phasing out – an ongoing debate) ([nucleareurope Facts & figures infographics](https://www.nucleareurope.eu/facts-figures/#:~:text=nucleareurope%20Facts%20%26%20figures%20infographics,of%20its%20low%20carbon%20electricity)). Scholarly assessments indicate that while complete energy autarky is unrealistic, Europe can achieve _secure_ energy independence by eliminating **unreliable or politically risky sources** and ensuring supply diversity ([Renewable energy | European Environment Agency's home page](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/topics/in-depth/renewable-energy#:~:text=Solar%20panels%20on%20rooftops%2C%20electric,largest%20source%20of%20%2020)). For example, importing gas from a range of friendly nations or via global LNG markets is far less risky than reliance on one authoritarian provider. Moreover, every percentage increase in renewables and efficiency directly reduces import needs, simultaneously advancing Europe’s climate goals and strategic autonomy ([Renewable energy | European Environment Agency's home page](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/topics/in-depth/renewable-energy#:~:text=While%20not%20without%20impact%2C%20replacing,to%20increasing%20Europe%E2%80%99s%20energy%20independence)). Modeling studies in energy economics suggest Europe can phase out almost all fossil fuel imports by 2040 with aggressive investment in green energy and some nuclear maintenance ([On the way to EU's clean energy transition: new approaches and ...](https://academic.oup.com/jwelb/article/17/1/69/7490869#:~:text=On%20the%20way%20to%20EU%27s,feasibility%20of%20the%20targets)) ([The need and opportunity for Europe's energy independence](https://www.friendsofeurope.org/insights/the-need-and-opportunity-for-europes-energy-independence/#:~:text=Europe%27s%20independence%20from%20Russian%20oil,Europe%27s%20economic%20growth)). In the interim, the EU’s strategy of stockpiling gas, setting up joint purchasing, and emergency sharing mechanisms has improved resilience. The plan’s proposal for energy independence is thus grounded in current reality: Europe is already moving towards that end-state, though it will take a decade or more to complete the transition. The key is to continue diversifying – not only geographically (e.g. more LNG terminals, pipelines to the Eastern Mediterranean and Caspian) but also technologically (e.g. adopting hydrogen fuel from surplus renewables, which the EU is funding). A caution from economists is that rushing into expensive alternatives can raise energy costs, harming European industry’s competitiveness ([Europe's messy Russian gas divorce - Brookings Institution](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/europes-messy-russian-gas-divorce/#:~:text=Europe%27s%20messy%20Russian%20gas%20divorce,much%20remains%20to%20be%20done)). Fortunately, the cost of renewables has plummeted, and recent crises have shown the cost of _not_ having alternatives (record-high gas prices in 2022). In refining the plan, policymakers should emphasize a balanced approach: pursue **“interdependence without overdependence”** ([A Closer Look at De-risking](https://www.csis.org/analysis/closer-look-de-risking#:~:text=inadvertently%20lead%20to%20a%20form,markets%20and%20increased%20geoeconomic%20resilience)) ([A Closer Look at De-risking](https://www.csis.org/analysis/closer-look-de-risking#:~:text=%E2%80%9Cre,markets%20and%20increased%20geoeconomic%20resilience)) by locking in multiple energy partners (including in Africa, the Middle East, and Americas) while accelerating the domestic clean energy build-out. This approach, advocated by the World Trade Organization as “re-globalization,” accepts that Europe will still trade energy but in a way that no single actor can blackmail the continent ([A Closer Look at De-risking](https://www.csis.org/analysis/closer-look-de-risking#:~:text=Ultimately%2C%20the%20distinction%20between%20de,markets%20and%20increased%20geoeconomic%20resilience)) ([A Closer Look at De-risking](https://www.csis.org/analysis/closer-look-de-risking#:~:text=inadvertently%20lead%20to%20a%20form,markets%20and%20increased%20geoeconomic%20resilience)). Overall, research supports the plan’s push for energy sovereignty – it is economically and technically feasible, especially given the momentum post-2022 – but it must be pursued with an eye to cost-effectiveness and regional cooperation (for instance, integrating European energy grids and storage to share renewables).

**Reshoring Industry and Securing Supply Chains:** The Resurgence Plan calls for Europe to reshore key supply chains and develop high-tech industries at home to avoid external dependencies (notably on the U.S. and China). Industrial policy is experiencing a renaissance in Europe in response to geopolitical pressures ([European Industrial Policy in the 2020s: Rationale, Challenges and Limitations - Intereconomics](https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2024/number/5/article/european-industrial-policy-in-the-2020s-rationale-challenges-and-limitations.html#:~:text=After%20the%20COVID,to%20blackmail%20and%2C%20as%20a)) ([European Industrial Policy in the 2020s: Rationale, Challenges and Limitations - Intereconomics](https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2024/number/5/article/european-industrial-policy-in-the-2020s-rationale-challenges-and-limitations.html#:~:text=Hence%20the%20case%20for%20industrial,in%20China%20and%20the%20USA)). Historically, the EU and member states were wary of heavy-handed industrial intervention, recalling past failures and inefficiencies (e.g. bloated state-owned enterprises in the 1970s). But recent shocks have shifted the consensus. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed that **“vulnerable supply chains”** (like 90% of antibiotics coming from China or India) can pose **negative externalities** for society when disrupted ([European Industrial Policy in the 2020s: Rationale, Challenges and Limitations - Intereconomics](https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2024/number/5/article/european-industrial-policy-in-the-2020s-rationale-challenges-and-limitations.html#:~:text=After%20the%20COVID,to%20blackmail%20and%2C%20as%20a)). Likewise, Europe’s over-reliance on single suppliers for critical inputs (Russian gas, Chinese rare earths, etc.) created vulnerabilities that purely market-driven decisions had overlooked ([European Industrial Policy in the 2020s: Rationale, Challenges and Limitations - Intereconomics](https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2024/number/5/article/european-industrial-policy-in-the-2020s-rationale-challenges-and-limitations.html#:~:text=an%20individual%20firm%E2%80%99s%20vulnerable%20supply,Hence)). Economists now recognize **“resilience and strategic autonomy”** as valid goals that justify selective industrial policies ([European Industrial Policy in the 2020s: Rationale, Challenges and Limitations - Intereconomics](https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2024/number/5/article/european-industrial-policy-in-the-2020s-rationale-challenges-and-limitations.html#:~:text=consequence%2C%20lose%20its%20strategic%20autonomy,important%20arguments%20for%20industrial%20policy)) ([European Industrial Policy in the 2020s: Rationale, Challenges and Limitations - Intereconomics](https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2024/number/5/article/european-industrial-policy-in-the-2020s-rationale-challenges-and-limitations.html#:~:text=Hence%20the%20case%20for%20industrial,in%20China%20and%20the%20USA)). The academic literature provides a nuanced view: well-designed industrial policy can correct market failures (like underinvestment in R&D) or foster new sectors, but poorly executed policy can waste resources and entrench inefficiency. For Europe, the key is coordinating at the _EU level_. In the past, uncoordinated national industrial policies led to duplication and internal competition – **“inefficiencies of uncoordinated national industrial policies became clear”**, prompting the EU to create common instruments in the 1980s and 1990s ([[PDF] 1 Industrial policy in Europe: past and future - Bruegel](https://www.bruegel.org/sites/default/files/2023-08/Bruegel%20Blueprint%2033_chapter%201.pdf#:~:text=Bruegel%20www,important%20instruments%20at%20EU)). Today, the EU is leveraging its Single Market to implement industrial strategies collectively: examples include the European Chips Act (a €43 billion plan to boost semiconductor manufacturing in Europe) and Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) for batteries, hydrogen, and microelectronics, which pool public and private investment across countries. These efforts seek to **reshore or “friend-shore”** supply chains in critical areas like microchips, green tech, and pharmaceuticals, so that Europe is not beholden to potential adversaries or disruptions. A classic case of successful European industrial policy is **Airbus**, often cited in literature ([European Industrial Policy in the 2020s: Rationale, Challenges and Limitations - Intereconomics](https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2024/number/5/article/european-industrial-policy-in-the-2020s-rationale-challenges-and-limitations.html#:~:text=While%20the%20case%20for%20industrial,to%20create%20a%20domestic%20automobile)). Airbus was a coordinated multinational project that created a global aerospace competitor – a high-tech industry Europe now leads, achieved by sharing costs and knowledge among France, Germany, Spain, and the UK. This success suggests that Europe _can_ develop high-tech industries when it pools talent and capital and sets clear goals. Other successes abroad, such as South Korea’s steel and shipbuilding emergence or China’s leap in solar panel production, show that active industrial strategies can work given persistence and scale ([European Industrial Policy in the 2020s: Rationale, Challenges and Limitations - Intereconomics](https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2024/number/5/article/european-industrial-policy-in-the-2020s-rationale-challenges-and-limitations.html#:~:text=While%20the%20case%20for%20industrial,to%20create%20a%20domestic%20automobile)). On the other hand, failures like Brazil’s attempt at a computer industry or some protectionist auto industry subsidies indicate the pitfalls of insulating companies from competition ([European Industrial Policy in the 2020s: Rationale, Challenges and Limitations - Intereconomics](https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2024/number/5/article/european-industrial-policy-in-the-2020s-rationale-challenges-and-limitations.html#:~:text=While%20the%20case%20for%20industrial,to%20create%20a%20domestic%20automobile)). To avoid inefficiency, Europe’s industrial policy must remain **“pro-competitive”** – i.e. nurturing domestic champions but not shielding them from market discipline ([[PDF] Procompetitive Industrial Policy – Note by the European Union - OECD](<https://one.oecd.org/document/DAF/COMP/WD(2024)18/en/pdf#:~:text=,of%20market%20power%2C%20and>)) ([[PDF] 1 Industrial policy in Europe: past and future - Bruegel](https://www.bruegel.org/sites/default/files/2023-08/Bruegel%20Blueprint%2033_chapter%201.pdf#:~:text=,important%20instruments%20at%20EU)). EU competition authorities have a role here: ensuring that subsidies foster innovation rather than rent-seeking. Encouragingly, the concept of a **“mission-oriented”** industrial policy (per economist Mariana Mazzucato) has gained traction – setting clear missions (e.g. 100% electric vehicle value chain in Europe, or cutting-edge chip fabs in EU) can guide public-private efforts and create new markets rather than just protecting old industries ([European Industrial Policy in the 2020s: Rationale, Challenges and Limitations - Intereconomics](https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2024/number/5/article/european-industrial-policy-in-the-2020s-rationale-challenges-and-limitations.html#:~:text=Already%20in%20the%20late%202010s%2C,2015)) ([European Industrial Policy in the 2020s: Rationale, Challenges and Limitations - Intereconomics](https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2024/number/5/article/european-industrial-policy-in-the-2020s-rationale-challenges-and-limitations.html#:~:text=Hence%20the%20case%20for%20industrial,in%20China%20and%20the%20USA)). The Resurgence Plan’s vision of reshoring must also factor in labor and cost issues: some supply chains (like basic textiles or low-end electronics) may never be economical in high-wage Europe, and it might be wiser to rely on trusted partners for those. The focus should be on **key strategic sectors** – those with high value-add, security importance, or future growth potential (e.g. semiconductors, batteries, AI and quantum computing, defense equipment, pharmaceuticals). European policy documents often refer to these as “critical technologies” for sovereignty. Economic modeling suggests that initial costs of reshoring can be high, but if done in sectors with increasing returns or strong spillovers (like tech industries), it can pay off via innovation and high-skilled job creation ([European Industrial Policy in the 2020s: Rationale, Challenges and Limitations - Intereconomics](https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2024/number/5/article/european-industrial-policy-in-the-2020s-rationale-challenges-and-limitations.html#:~:text=welfare%2C%20incomes%20and%20jobs,future%20losses%20in%20national%20welfare)). Additionally, by reshoring or diversifying supply sources, Europe insures itself against supply shocks that could be even more costly (this is akin to paying a premium for insurance). To implement this sustainably, the EU may need to reform some rules – for instance, loosening strict state-aid regulations to allow strategic investments (this has already happened with temporary frameworks for chips and batteries). It also means creating incentives for private industry: tax credits for R&D, investment in STEM education to have the workforce, and facilitating scale-up (one reason tech manufacturing gravitated to U.S. and China is the ease of scaling businesses there). In summary, the Plan’s economic pillar on supply chains is reinforced by contemporary scholarship: there is a newfound **“overwhelming case for industrial policy”** in light of geopolitics ([European Industrial Policy in the 2020s: Rationale, Challenges and Limitations - Intereconomics](https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2024/number/5/article/european-industrial-policy-in-the-2020s-rationale-challenges-and-limitations.html#:~:text=Hence%20the%20case%20for%20industrial,in%20China%20and%20the%20USA)), but Europe must execute it smartly. The Plan should incorporate safeguards against inefficiency – regular evaluations of industrial projects, sunset clauses for subsidies, and an emphasis on innovation (so Europe doesn’t prop up yesterday’s industries but builds tomorrow’s). By referencing both historical successes and failures, the Plan can justify its strategies (e.g., evoke **Airbus as a model** ([European Industrial Policy in the 2020s: Rationale, Challenges and Limitations - Intereconomics](https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2024/number/5/article/european-industrial-policy-in-the-2020s-rationale-challenges-and-limitations.html#:~:text=While%20the%20case%20for%20industrial,to%20create%20a%20domestic%20automobile)) for pan-European cooperation in, say, semiconductor manufacturing) and preempt criticism by showing awareness of the need for economic viability.

**Decoupling from U.S. and Chinese Influence:** European economic sovereignty also implies lessening the dominance of external powers – notably the U.S. and China – over Europe’s markets, technology, and finance. However, the term “decoupling” is often viewed as extreme; European leaders have instead embraced **“de-risking”** – reducing strategic dependencies while preserving beneficial trade ([The EU has a playbook to de-risk from China. Is it working?](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-eu-has-a-playbook-to-de-risk-from-china-is-it-working/#:~:text=The%20European%20Union%E2%80%99s%20,later%20embraced%20by%20the%20Biden)) ([The EU has a playbook to de-risk from China. Is it working?](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-eu-has-a-playbook-to-de-risk-from-china-is-it-working/#:~:text=the%20EU%20has%20developed%20a,In%20fact%2C%20the%20term%20%E2%80%9Cde)). The EU’s approach, as articulated by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, is built on three pillars: **protect, promote, and partner** ([The EU has a playbook to de-risk from China. Is it working?](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-eu-has-a-playbook-to-de-risk-from-china-is-it-working/#:~:text=The%20European%20Union%E2%80%99s%20,later%20embraced%20by%20the%20Biden)). “Protect” means safeguarding critical sectors from unwanted influence (e.g., screening foreign investments in critical infrastructure, which the EU now does, or blocking exports of sensitive tech). “Promote” refers to strengthening Europe’s own capabilities and competitiveness (through innovation, skills, etc.). “Partner” involves working with alternative allies to diversify economic relations ([The EU has a playbook to de-risk from China. Is it working?](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-eu-has-a-playbook-to-de-risk-from-china-is-it-working/#:~:text=The%20EU%20is%20also%20forging,It%20has%20deepened)). This strategy acknowledges that outright decoupling from the U.S. (an ally) is not desired, and decoupling from China (a systemic rival but also a key market) is costly. Instead, Europe is selectively disentangling in areas where dependency equals vulnerability – for example, reducing reliance on China for 5G telecom equipment (many EU states restricted Huawei/ZTE on security grounds) or for critical minerals (launching partnerships with countries like Canada, Australia, and African nations for rare earth supply). The benefits of such decoupling or de-risking include greater **supply security, political autonomy, and encouragement of domestic industries**, but there are also risks: **economic retaliation and efficiency losses**. If Europe severely restricts trade with China, China could retaliate against European exporters (like Germany’s car industry, which sells a huge volume in China). Additionally, consumers and firms in Europe might face higher costs if cheaper imports or manufacturing options are cut off. Studies by the German think-tank IFRI and others note that **Europe’s dependency on China as a market and production base is still high, and most EU states are not prepared for a full economic decoupling** ([Disengagement from China: United States and European Union ...](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/publications/giga-focus/disengagement-from-china-united-states-european-union-policies-compared#:~:text=Disengagement%20from%20China%3A%20United%20States,prepared%20for%20an%20economic%20decoupling)) ([Disengagement from China: United States and European Union ...](https://www.giga-hamburg.de/en/publications/giga-focus/disengagement-from-china-united-states-european-union-policies-compared#:~:text=Europe%27s%20dependency%20on%20China%20as,prepared%20for%20an%20economic%20decoupling)). This suggests the Plan should calibrate the degree of decoupling: focus on critical areas (technology, defense-related supply chains, energy) but avoid severing general trade in non-strategic goods. Indeed, Europe’s trade with China hit €739 billion in 2023 ([EU trade relations with China - European Union](https://policy.trade.ec.europa.eu/eu-trade-relationships-country-and-region/countries-and-regions/china_en#:~:text=China%20is%20the%20EU%27s%20second,reaching%20%E2%82%AC739%20billion%20in%202023)); immediately cutting this would shock Europe’s economy. A peer-reviewed analysis from CSIS points out that even the U.S., despite its tough rhetoric, has shifted from “decoupling” to “de-risking” because **the interdependence is so deep (the U.S. and China trade over $600 billion annually and are entwined in finance) that decoupling would fragment the global economy** ([A Closer Look at De-risking](https://www.csis.org/analysis/closer-look-de-risking#:~:text=These%20two%20nations%20account%20for,risking%20strategy)) ([A Closer Look at De-risking](https://www.csis.org/analysis/closer-look-de-risking#:~:text=Some%20onlookers%20have%20raised%20concerns,and%20reshape%20the%20global%20order)). Instead, both Washington and Brussels are aiming for **“interdependence without overdependence”** ([A Closer Look at De-risking](https://www.csis.org/analysis/closer-look-de-risking#:~:text=inadvertently%20lead%20to%20a%20form,markets%20and%20increased%20geoeconomic%20resilience)) ([A Closer Look at De-risking](https://www.csis.org/analysis/closer-look-de-risking#:~:text=%E2%80%9Cre,markets%20and%20increased%20geoeconomic%20resilience)). For Europe, that might mean, for example, buying Chinese consumer goods is fine, but not letting China monopolize battery production for European electric cars. Or continuing transatlantic digital commerce, but developing European cloud services and not relying solely on U.S. tech giants for data infrastructure. Another element is currency and finance: decoupling from U.S. influence could involve making the euro more prominent globally so that Europe isn’t as subject to U.S. financial sanctions or dollar fluctuations. The euro is already the second reserve currency, but increased use in energy trade (recently some gas contracts switched to euros) and in international lending could reduce the “exorbitant privilege” of the dollar over Europe. The Plan can draw on international economics research that warns of **“geo-economic fragmentation”** if blocs fully decouple ([A Closer Look at De-risking](https://www.csis.org/analysis/closer-look-de-risking#:~:text=Some%20onlookers%20have%20raised%20concerns,and%20reshape%20the%20global%20order)). Fragmentation would likely reduce global growth and innovation, which would also hurt Europe. Therefore, the Plan’s stance – and academic consensus – is to mitigate undue influences rather than end all interdependence. For instance, Europe might **decouple from China in critical tech (like not exporting the most advanced chip-making tools) but continue normal trade in apparel or machinery**. With the U.S., Europe might assert regulatory independence (e.g., tax U.S. tech companies fairly, or challenge extraterritorial sanctions where they hurt European interests) without disrupting the fundamental alliance. One example of a measured approach is the EU raising tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles in response to unfair subsidies ([The EU has a playbook to de-risk from China. Is it working?](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-eu-has-a-playbook-to-de-risk-from-china-is-it-working/#:~:text=The%20European%20Union%E2%80%99s%20,later%20embraced%20by%20the%20Biden)) – this protects a nascent EU industry (EVs) and pushes back on China’s practices, but it’s a targeted move, not a broad decoupling. In refining the Plan, one can incorporate language of **“open strategic autonomy”** – the EU’s term for being open to trade but insistent on autonomy where it matters. Scholarly debates (e.g., at MERICS or Bruegel think tanks) suggest Europe should coordinate with the U.S. when possible (to amplify leverage over China) but also stand firm on its own interests (e.g., maintaining trade with China in areas like green tech cooperation, where the U.S. might be more confrontational) ([Judy Asks: Can Europe Influence U.S.-China Rivalry? | Carnegie Endowment for International Peace](https://carnegieendowment.org/europe/strategic-europe/2023/02/judy-asks-can-europe-influence-us-china-rivalry?lang=en#:~:text=Still%2C%20Europe%20plays%20a%20major,to%20Western%20technology%20and%20markets)) ([Judy Asks: Can Europe Influence U.S.-China Rivalry? | Carnegie Endowment for International Peace](https://carnegieendowment.org/europe/strategic-europe/2023/02/judy-asks-can-europe-influence-us-china-rivalry?lang=en#:~:text=Europe%20may%20be%20less%20hawkish,approach%20to%20China%20becomes%20friendlier)). Ultimately, the Plan’s economic sovereignty goals are sustainable if they are pursued via de-risking: diversify supply sources, invest in European alternatives, and use defensive tools (tariffs, export controls) judiciously. This nuanced approach will _reduce_ U.S. and Chinese influence – Europe will be neither an American economic dependency nor a captive market for China – while avoiding self-isolation.

**Tariffs, Trade Alliances, and Regulatory Overhaul:** To foster economic sovereignty, the Plan suggests using tariffs and trade policy, forming new trade alliances, and overhauling regulations that impede autonomy. Europe has significant leverage as a trade superpower: it is the world’s largest trading bloc and often a rule-maker in global commerce. The concept of the **“Brussels Effect”** in academic literature highlights how EU regulations in areas like data privacy, environmental standards, and product safety become de facto global standards due to the EU’s market size ([The European Union in a globalised world: the "Brussels effect"](https://geopolitique.eu/en/articles/the-european-union-in-a-globalised-world-the-brussels-effect/#:~:text=The%20European%20Union%20in%20a,its%20unilateral%20global%20regulatory%20power)). By deploying its regulatory power, Europe can both protect its market from under-regulated foreign goods and push others to level up. For example, the EU’s strict General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) forced multinational tech firms worldwide to adopt higher privacy standards to continue doing business in Europe – **a unilateral global regulatory impact** ([The European Union in a globalised world: the "Brussels effect"](https://geopolitique.eu/en/articles/the-european-union-in-a-globalised-world-the-brussels-effect/#:~:text=The%20European%20Union%20in%20a,its%20unilateral%20global%20regulatory%20power)). In economic statecraft terms, this is a form of _offensive_ tariff/non-tariff measure: instead of a traditional tariff, it’s a regulatory barrier that reflects European values and interests, effectively shaping terms of trade. The Plan can capitalize on this by ensuring EU regulations favor domestic and trusted producers (without overt protectionism, which could violate WTO rules). In areas critical to sovereignty, though, **tariffs or strategic protection** might be warranted – for instance, the EU is considering tariffs on high-carbon imports via a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism to protect its climate agenda, and it has invoked safeguard tariffs in the past to defend steel or agriculture from dumping. As noted, the EU’s investigation into Chinese EV imports for possible tariffs ([The EU has a playbook to de-risk from China. Is it working?](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-eu-has-a-playbook-to-de-risk-from-china-is-it-working/#:~:text=The%20European%20Union%E2%80%99s%20,later%20embraced%20by%20the%20Biden)) shows a new willingness to use trade remedies to nurture strategic industries (electric vehicles, batteries) that Europe deems essential for its future. Aligning with scholarly analysis, such measures can be effective if they incentivize reciprocal fairness or investment in Europe, but they should be temporary or reviewable to avoid permanent inefficiency.

Forming **trade alliances** is another prong. Europe has been actively negotiating free trade agreements (FTAs) in recent years with regions beyond its traditional partners. For instance, it concluded deals with Canada (CETA), Japan, and Vietnam, and is negotiating with Mercosur (South America) and India. By building a network of trade alliances, the EU not only opens new markets for its exporters but also reduces reliance on any single partner (like the U.S. or China). A _renewed focus on Africa_ in trade could be particularly significant: helping African economies industrialize via fair trade deals would create alternatives to Chinese influence there and new demand for European goods. The Plan mentions deepening ties with Turkey, Mexico, Canada, and Australia – these fit into a strategy of like-minded or strategically located partners. Canada and Australia already have close strategic alignment with Europe and the U.S.; enhancing trade and tech cooperation with them (the EU-Australia FTA talks, for example, or joint critical minerals projects with Canada) can secure supplies of resources and diversify export markets. Mexico is an interesting case: it’s next door to the U.S. but also part of Latin America. The EU-Mexico Global Agreement (updated in 2018, awaiting full ratification) will liberalize most trade and institute modern rules on sustainable development – this not only benefits Europe’s economy but also cements an alliance with the world’s 15th-largest economy. Turkey, while more complex due to political issues, is economically intertwined with Europe through a customs union. A recalibration of EU-Turkey economic ties (perhaps updating the customs union to include services and agriculture) could lock Turkey closer to Europe economically, which in turn could support diplomatic alignment. In all these cases, trade alliances serve both economic and geopolitical aims: **fostering a web of interdependence that Europe can leverage**. Studies in international political economy show that diversified trade links improve a nation’s bargaining position – if one partner falters or pressures you, you have others to rely on. Thus, the Plan’s advocacy for broadening trade partnerships is well-founded.

Regarding **regulatory overhauls**, Europe might need to reform internal rules that hamper rapid industrial adaptation. For example, EU procurement rules and competition laws sometimes delay joint defense projects or the emergence of European champions. The Plan could suggest streamlined approval for collaborative projects in strategic sectors (the EU is already moving in this direction by exempting certain IPCEIs from strict state aid rules). Another regulatory aspect is reducing bureaucracy for innovation: ease the path for startups, improve patent processes, and invest in human capital. Europe’s highly skilled workforce is an asset, but brain drain to Silicon Valley has been an issue – better incentives and a vibrant tech ecosystem are needed to keep talent. An _academic consensus_ exists that Europe historically lagged in the digital revolution partly due to a fragmented market and heavy regulations; learning from that, the EU’s current approach to emerging tech (like AI Act, Chips Act) tries to balance oversight with fostering growth. The Plan should support regulatory changes that encourage R&D and agile development (like easier cross-border data flows within Europe to train AI, or faster permitting for new energy infrastructure). Additionally, **tariff policy** in a strategic sense could include **defensive tariffs** against dumping or coercion. The EU is adopting an Anti-Coercion Instrument which will allow it to retaliate with trade measures if, say, China boycotts an EU country for political reasons (as happened to Lithuania in 2021). Such tools ensure Europe can **“exert pressure on geopolitical competitors”** through trade and finance when needed, a topic that will be elaborated in the strategic section. In summary, the economic sustainability of the Resurgence Plan rests on reducing dependency and boosting self-reliance _without isolating Europe_. Peer-reviewed economic analyses largely agree that Europe should pursue **“open autonomy”** – remain an open economy but with safeguards and capacity to withstand shocks ([The EU has a playbook to de-risk from China. Is it working?](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-eu-has-a-playbook-to-de-risk-from-china-is-it-working/#:~:text=Brussels%20does%20not%20use%20Washington%E2%80%99s,a%20different%20sense%20of%20urgency)) ([The EU has a playbook to de-risk from China. Is it working?](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-eu-has-a-playbook-to-de-risk-from-china-is-it-working/#:~:text=Brussels%20does%20not%20use%20Washington%E2%80%99s,agendas%2C%20but%20the%20EU%20approaches)). By implementing measured tariffs, forging alliances across the globe, and fine-tuning regulations to spur innovation and strategic industries, Europe can achieve a more sovereign economy. This will help ensure that Europe’s prosperity is not at the mercy of others, thereby underpinning the Plan’s vision of a Europe strong enough to chart its own course.

## Diplomatic Viability

**Great Power Rise and Decline: Lessons for Europe’s Trajectory:** Europe’s ambition to reassert itself must heed the historical patterns of great power dynamics. In the classic analysis of Paul Kennedy’s _The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers_, economic strength and technological innovation are the foundations of military and political power, and overstretch or internal divisions precipitate decline. For much of modern history (1500- twentieth century), Europe was the center of global power – first as individual empires (Spain, France, Britain, etc.), then collectively accounting for a dominant share of world GDP and military might. However, two catastrophic world wars and the rise of the U.S. and USSR drastically reduced Europe’s relative position by 1950. Europe’s decline was not due to lack of knowledge or resources, but partly because incessant **internal rivalries and wars** drained its power – as one analysis notes, the lack of a supreme authority in Europe spurred constant military competition, which fueled innovation but also **ultimately exhausted the European powers** in fratricidal conflicts ([[PDF] The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers: from Paul Kennedy](https://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/services/dropoff/china_civ_temp/week07/pdfs/theris.pdf#:~:text=,constant%20search%20for%20military)). The U.S., by contrast, benefited from unity across a continent-sized nation and emerged largely unscathed economically from the world wars, allowing it to surpass the fragmented Europeans. The lesson for the EU is clear: unity and avoidance of internecine conflict are prerequisites for sustained power. Since 1950, Europe’s trajectory has been unique – instead of remaining divided or coalescing into a single state, it built the European Union, a sui generis entity that pools sovereignty in selective ways. The EU has undeniably increased Europe’s global clout compared to a scenario of disunited small states. For instance, the EU (plus UK) today comprises about **16% of global GDP – roughly on par with the U.S. and China** (each around 16-18% as well) ([Europe Narrowly Navigates De-risking Between Washington and Beijing | Carnegie Endowment for International Peace](https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2023/07/europe-narrowly-navigates-de-risking-between-washington-and-beijing?lang=en#:~:text=Europe%20holds%20this%20pivotal%20position,why%20Washington%20views%20trade%20relations)). In terms of trade, the EU actually leads: it accounts for a substantial share of world trade in goods and services ([Europe Narrowly Navigates De-risking Between Washington and Beijing | Carnegie Endowment for International Peace](https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2023/07/europe-narrowly-navigates-de-risking-between-washington-and-beijing?lang=en#:~:text=Europe%20holds%20this%20pivotal%20position,why%20Washington%20views%20trade%20relations)). This economic heft gives Europe potential leverage befitting a great power. Yet politically and militarily, Europe often punches below its weight. A scholar at Bruegel observed that the EU, despite an economy comparable to the U.S. or China, has been **“increasingly sidelined”** in major geopolitical debates due to **limited hard power and its own fragmentation** ([Judy Asks: Can Europe Influence U.S.-China Rivalry? | Carnegie Endowment for International Peace](https://carnegieendowment.org/europe/strategic-europe/2023/02/judy-asks-can-europe-influence-us-china-rivalry?lang=en#:~:text=It%20is%20hard%20to%20think,increasingly%20sidelined%20in%20this%20debate)). This encapsulates the challenge: if Europe wants to _rise_ again as a great power center, it must overcome internal divisions (speak and act more as one on foreign policy) and bolster its hard power (military and strategic capabilities) to complement its economic power. Historical patterns also highlight the importance of demographic and technological trends. Europe’s population is aging and will form a smaller percentage of world population by 2050, whereas powers like India or Africa’s nations are rising demographically. Great powers typically innovate or harness new technologies during their rise (Britain with the Industrial Revolution, the U.S. with the digital revolution, etc.). Europe needs to be at the forefront of the next technological wave (AI, biotech, green tech) to avoid falling behind. If the EU can channel resources into innovation (it has the talent and research institutions to do so), it can compensate for demographic slowdowns with productivity gains. Another historical analogy: some empires managed to reinvent themselves (the British, after losing America, focused on India and industrial leadership to remain a top power in the 19th century), while others stagnated. The EU’s opportunity to reinvent itself came after the Cold War with enlargement and integration – it seized it partially but also assumed a post-historical posture, focusing on economic integration and “soft power.” The current geopolitical environment – a more confrontational Russia, a rising assertive China, and a potentially less reliable U.S. – is forcing the EU to **“wake up geopolitically”** ([Onwards and outwards: Why the EU needs to move from strategic autonomy to strategic interdependence | ECFR](https://ecfr.eu/article/onwards-and-outwards-why-the-eu-needs-to-move-from-strategic-autonomy-to-strategic-interdependence/#:~:text=The%20European%20Union%20and%20its,its%20trade%20with%20a%20blockade)). This is analogous to earlier eras when a power had to adapt or be eclipsed. International relations theory (like power transition theory) suggests that if Europe doesn’t assert itself, it will be relegated to secondary status in a U.S.-China bipolar system. But a _united_ Europe can form a “third pole” in a multipolar system ([Europe Narrowly Navigates De-risking Between Washington and Beijing | Carnegie Endowment for International Peace](https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2023/07/europe-narrowly-navigates-de-risking-between-washington-and-beijing?lang=en#:~:text=Washington%20can%E2%80%99t%20decouple%20from%20China,Brussels%20in%20a%20pivotal%20position)) ([Europe Narrowly Navigates De-risking Between Washington and Beijing | Carnegie Endowment for International Peace](https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2023/07/europe-narrowly-navigates-de-risking-between-washington-and-beijing?lang=en#:~:text=Amid%20escalating%20tensions%20between%20the,first%20approach)), shaping global norms and mediating between East and West. The Plan should thus internalize the lesson that **only collective European strength can reverse decline** – no single European country alone, not even Germany or France, can be a great power in the 21st century by itself (each is ~2-3% of world GDP, not 16% like the EU as a whole). The viability of Europe’s resurgence hinges on deepening integration where it counts (foreign policy, defense, high-tech strategy), effectively acting as one. Additionally, avoiding overstretch is key: Europe should be mindful not to commit to burdens beyond its capacity (for example, engaging in protracted conflicts abroad without U.S. support could be risky until its capabilities grow). In that regard, some decline-of-power theorists warn against “imperial overstretch” – Europe’s colonial empires fell when costs exceeded benefits. Today’s equivalent might be spending too much on external commitments and too little on renewal at home. The Plan appears to get this balance right by focusing first on bolstering internal strength (military and economy) before projecting power. In sum, historical and scholarly perspectives validate Europe’s potential to _rise_ again, but only if it consolidates its union and avoids the twin perils of fragmentation and overstretch. Europe’s current trajectory is not predetermined – it could continue relatively declining if it remains internally disunited and militarily weak, or it could experience a resurgence if it acts in concert. The late 20th-century showed a partial European resurgence via the Single Market and common currency, but the early 21st saw stagnation in strategic clout. The Plan’s proposals, adjusted for realism, aim to restart the momentum, learning from history that **economic vitality + unity + innovation** are the formula for great power status.

**Post-Colonial Partnerships with Africa:** The Plan emphasizes forging effective, non-exploitative alliances with Africa – a wise strategy given Africa’s rising importance. By 2050, 1 in 4 people in the world will be African ([What a True Partnership of Equals Would Mean for the European Union and African Union | Center For Global Development](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/what-true-partnership-equals-would-mean-european-union-and-african-union#:~:text=by%202050%20www,a%20true%20partnership%20of%20equals)), and the continent is rich in natural resources and youthful human capital. Europe and Africa have a long, fraught history: colonialism left deep imbalances and mistrust. For decades after decolonization, Europe’s approach was often paternalistic, centered on development aid and asymmetrical trade deals that primarily benefited Europe (e.g. securing raw materials) ([What a True Partnership of Equals Would Mean for the European Union and African Union | Center For Global Development](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/what-true-partnership-equals-would-mean-european-union-and-african-union#:~:text=Africa%E2%80%99s%20future%20requires%20bold%20and,European%20knowledge%2C%20experience%2C%20and%20expertise)). This is no longer tenable or desirable. African nations demand relationships of dignity and mutual benefit – a **“partnership of equals”** in rhetoric that must be made reality ([Decolonising EU-Africa Relations Is A Pre-Condition For A True ...](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/decolonising-eu-africa-relations-pre-condition-true-partnership-equals#:~:text=Decolonising%20EU,CGD)). Academic discourse (including post-colonial analyses) argues that Europe must **decolonize its mindset** and treat African states as true partners, allowing them agency in setting priorities ([What a True Partnership of Equals Would Mean for the European Union and African Union | Center For Global Development](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/what-true-partnership-equals-would-mean-european-union-and-african-union#:~:text=The%20power%20dynamics%20between%20Europe,the%20EU%E2%80%99s%20strategies%20and%20policies)). Concretely, this means African voices (through the African Union, for instance) should help shape initiatives rather than Europe unilaterally deciding what’s best. It also means focusing beyond just aid. As one expert notes, the EU’s traditional aid-centric relationship **“has not always resulted in meaningful impact”** and has been too narrow ([What a True Partnership of Equals Would Mean for the European Union and African Union | Center For Global Development](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/what-true-partnership-equals-would-mean-european-union-and-african-union#:~:text=Europe%20and%20Africa%20have%20had,European%20knowledge%2C%20experience%2C%20and%20expertise)). Countries like Guinea received EU funds for infrastructure, but EU cooperation didn’t extend to areas like research, innovation, or higher education that could leapfrog development ([What a True Partnership of Equals Would Mean for the European Union and African Union | Center For Global Development](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/what-true-partnership-equals-would-mean-european-union-and-african-union#:~:text=In%20practical%20terms%2C%20these%20agreements,solutions%20in%20difficult%20developmental%20contexts)) ([What a True Partnership of Equals Would Mean for the European Union and African Union | Center For Global Development](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/what-true-partnership-equals-would-mean-european-union-and-african-union#:~:text=other%20types%20of%20cooperation%20like,from%20experts%20of%20highest%20caliber)). On the other hand, South Africa’s broader cooperation with the EU (covering trade, science, etc.) shows what a more well-rounded partnership can achieve ([What a True Partnership of Equals Would Mean for the European Union and African Union | Center For Global Development](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/what-true-partnership-equals-would-mean-european-union-and-african-union#:~:text=struggle%20to%20attract%20the%20best,from%20experts%20of%20highest%20caliber)). The Plan should thus champion a shift “beyond aid.” European and African interests overlap in many areas: climate change (Africa will be heavily impacted, and has huge renewable energy potential that investment can unlock), migration (creating jobs in Africa can mitigate forced migration), security (fighting terrorism in the Sahel, for example, requires African-EU cooperation), and economic growth (a prosperous Africa means new markets for European goods and a source of innovation). An equal alliance entails joint ventures – e.g., European firms building manufacturing in Africa, employing and training local workers, rather than just extracting raw materials. It also means fair trade terms: the EU has begun moving in this direction with initiatives like the African Continental Free Trade Area support and proposals to ensure African producers climb the value chain (instead of, say, just exporting cocoa beans, African countries getting support to produce chocolate). The **EU-AU Summit in 2022** announced an “Africa-Europe Investment Package” of €150 billion for sustainable development, signaling Europe’s recognition that investment (not just aid) is key ([EU-AU summit: two unions, one vision | FPS Foreign Affairs](http://diplomatie.belgium.be/en/policy/policy-areas/highlighted/eu-au-summit-two-unions-one-vision#:~:text=EU,AU%20summit)). Still, African observers often remain skeptical, citing a gap between EU rhetoric of “equal partnership” and practice ([Turning the rhetoric of an 'equal partnership' into practice](https://www.friendsofeurope.org/insights/critical-thinking-turning-the-rhetoric-of-an-equal-partnership-into-practice/#:~:text=Turning%20the%20rhetoric%20of%20an,rhetorical%2C%20seldom%20implemented%20in%20practice)). To be viable, the Plan must acknowledge and address this credibility gap. One recommendation is to allow African partners to critique and shape EU strategies openly ([What a True Partnership of Equals Would Mean for the European Union and African Union | Center For Global Development](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/what-true-partnership-equals-would-mean-european-union-and-african-union#:~:text=It%20is%20important%20for%20African,in%20drafting%20partnership%20strategies%20by)) ([What a True Partnership of Equals Would Mean for the European Union and African Union | Center For Global Development](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/what-true-partnership-equals-would-mean-european-union-and-african-union#:~:text=and%20regional%20economic%20integration)). For example, if African leaders say a particular EU agricultural subsidy is harming African farmers, the EU should be willing to adjust it in the spirit of partnership. Another aspect is moving beyond government-to-government relations: facilitating more people-to-people contacts, academic exchanges, and civil society links, so the partnership is broad-based. Europe should also learn from and avoid the mistakes of other powers: China, which has become a major player in Africa, has faced backlash at times for being too extractive or for burdening countries with debt. African diplomats have **“expressed frustration”** that even China’s much-touted cooperation can be one-sided and dictated by Beijing’s priorities ([What a True Partnership of Equals Would Mean for the European Union and African Union | Center For Global Development](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/what-true-partnership-equals-would-mean-european-union-and-african-union#:~:text=example%2C%20the%20agenda%20for%20the,change%2C%20and%20regional%20economic%20integration)). Europe could differentiate itself by being more attentive to African-defined priorities like job creation, addressing debt sustainability, and supporting regional integration in Africa. Historically, Europe’s own integration was partly spurred by aid (the Marshall Plan) and equal collaboration with the U.S. after WWII; a similar spirit of genuine partnership could redefine EU-Africa relations. If successful, such an alliance yields mutual gains: Africa gains technology, infrastructure, and markets for its products beyond raw commodities, while Europe gains reliable allies, access to a vast growing market, and perhaps preferential access to critical minerals needed for the green transition (cobalt, lithium, etc., much of which is in Africa). Importantly, a stable and prosperous Africa also means reduced conflict, terrorism, and irregular migration – directly benefiting European stability. In diplomatic terms, closer Africa-Europe ties could translate to support in international forums (African votes aligning with EU positions at the UN on issues of global governance, for instance). The Plan therefore is diplomatically viable if it builds on the understanding that Europe’s past dominance must give way to respectful cooperation. The **post-colonial lens** in scholarly work insists that only by acknowledging historical injustices and power imbalances can a truly equal partnership emerge ([Decolonising EU-Africa Relations Is A Pre-Condition For A True ...](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/decolonising-eu-africa-relations-pre-condition-true-partnership-equals#:~:text=Decolonising%20EU,CGD)) ([Decolonising EU-Africa Relations Is A Pre-Condition For A True ...](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/decolonising-eu-africa-relations-pre-condition-true-partnership-equals#:~:text=But%20a%20true%20partnership%20of,CGD)). This might involve symbolic steps (apologies for colonial-era atrocities, returning cultural artifacts – things already underway) alongside practical ones (involving the African Union in G20 meetings, as now agreed, or supporting African candidates for leadership positions in multilateral organizations). By embedding these approaches, the Plan’s African strategy aligns with contemporary development and IR scholarship that calls for a **“reset”** of EU-Africa relations based on equality, mutual interest, and local ownership of projects ([What a True Partnership of Equals Would Mean for the European Union and African Union | Center For Global Development](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/what-true-partnership-equals-would-mean-european-union-and-african-union#:~:text=by%202050%20www,a%20true%20partnership%20of%20equals)) ([What a True Partnership of Equals Would Mean for the European Union and African Union | Center For Global Development](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/what-true-partnership-equals-would-mean-european-union-and-african-union#:~:text=The%20power%20dynamics%20between%20Europe,the%20EU%E2%80%99s%20strategies%20and%20policies)).

**Balancing Relations with BRICS, Russia, and the U.S.:** Europe finds itself navigating a complex geopolitical landscape – it is allied with the United States, at odds with a revanchist Russia, and economically interlinked with China and other BRICS countries (Brazil, India, South Africa). The Resurgence Plan envisions Europe prioritizing its own interests and not simply being pulled by other great powers. This requires a delicate balancing act. Historically, Europe (especially during the Cold War) aligned strongly with the U.S. for security, while engaging the Soviet Union in détente from a position of unity via the European Community. Today, a similar approach can be adopted: maintain the transatlantic alliance but assert a European voice within it, and engage other powers independently to serve mutual interests.

For **Russia**, currently Europe’s policy is dominated by the response to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine – sanctions and isolation. The Plan might suggest how Europe should handle Russia in the long term once the immediate crisis abates. Lessons from great-power politics indicate that completely cornering a power can be dangerous; at some stage, negotiations or new security arrangements may be needed. Europe should be prepared to eventually lead on crafting a stable order in Eastern Europe – this could involve arms control agreements or phased reconciliation if Russia’s leadership changes behavior. However, any alliance _with_ Russia is unrealistic in the short term and morally untenable under current circumstances. So balancing Russia means combining strength (continued deterrence and a hard line against expansionism) with openness to dialogue on issues like arms control, to avoid miscalculation. Europe can take the lead on issues like renewing nuclear arms treaties that the U.S. and Russia have let lapse, since it is Europe’s continent at stake. Prioritizing European interests here means, for example, ensuring that any future deal with Russia (on energy or security) does not sacrifice smaller European states’ security. That has been a criticism in the past (e.g., Nord Stream pipelines were seen as Germany prioritizing cheap gas over Eastern European strategic concerns). A validated Plan would insist that Europe speak largely with one voice to Russia, preventing Moscow from exploiting divides (a classic Russian strategy).

With **China and the broader BRICS**: Europe’s challenge is to avoid being caught in a U.S.-China bipolar confrontation where it has to choose sides on everything. Europe’s interests sometimes align with the U.S. (human rights, rule of law, freedom of navigation) and sometimes diverge (Europe has more direct economic reliance on China and may seek a less confrontational approach). Scholarly commentary suggests Europe should indeed **“balance a transactional approach with pragmatism”**, identifying areas it wants to influence in its favor like economic stability or cyber security ([Judy Asks: Can Europe Influence U.S.-China Rivalry? | Carnegie Endowment for International Peace](https://carnegieendowment.org/europe/strategic-europe/2023/02/judy-asks-can-europe-influence-us-china-rivalry?lang=en#:~:text=In%20the%20end%2C%20for%20Europe%2C,to%20be%20taken%20into%20account)) ([Judy Asks: Can Europe Influence U.S.-China Rivalry? | Carnegie Endowment for International Peace](https://carnegieendowment.org/europe/strategic-europe/2023/02/judy-asks-can-europe-influence-us-china-rivalry?lang=en#:~:text=situations%20where%20sometimes%20China%20is,is%20not%20always%20a%20given)). Europe has labeled China a partner, competitor, and systemic rival all at once – reflecting this balance. The Plan can make use of Europe’s **“pivotal position”**: as Carnegie analysts note, Washington **“can’t decouple from China without Europe’s help, while China hopes to soften Europe’s stance”**, putting Brussels in a position to potentially sway outcomes ([Europe Narrowly Navigates De-risking Between Washington and Beijing | Carnegie Endowment for International Peace](https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2023/07/europe-narrowly-navigates-de-risking-between-washington-and-beijing?lang=en#:~:text=Europe%20Narrowly%20Navigates%20De,Washington%20and%20Beijing)) ([Europe Narrowly Navigates De-risking Between Washington and Beijing | Carnegie Endowment for International Peace](https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2023/07/europe-narrowly-navigates-de-risking-between-washington-and-beijing?lang=en#:~:text=Amid%20escalating%20tensions%20between%20the,first%20approach)). Europe can use this to extract concessions from both sides – for instance, cooperate with the U.S. on technology standards vis-à-vis China, but only if the U.S. in return refrains from policies harming European firms (like unilateral sanctions). Conversely, engage with China on climate change or trade, but insist China address certain European concerns (like ending coercion of EU member states or improving market access terms). This triangulation is delicate but not without precedent; during the Cold War’s latter half, Western Europe improved relations with the USSR (through Ostpolitik and the Helsinki Accords) while still being a U.S. ally – carving out a European détente that served Europe’s interest in peace. Similarly, Europe today could act as a mediator or at least an independent pole that dialogues with everyone. India, Brazil, and South Africa (key BRICS members) are more natural partners for Europe in some ways – they are democracies and do not directly threaten Europe. The EU has strategic partnerships with India and Brazil, for example. Prioritizing European interests means seeking alignment with these powers on global issues like climate and trade, even if the U.S. is less focused on them. For instance, the EU worked closely with India to advocate for multilateral solutions on COVID-19 (like vaccine distribution), showing leadership independent of U.S.-China rivalry. A potential risk in balancing is that Europe could alienate the U.S. if seen as too accommodating to China, or vice versa. But as long as Europe’s stance is principled (defending a rules-based order, human rights, etc.), it can justify engagement with all sides. A **multi-alignment strategy** is mentioned in IR theory as an option for middle powers: the EU could be a “soft balancing” force that checks U.S. or Chinese excesses by rallying international norms and coalitions (for example, Europe led on the Iran nuclear deal diplomacy, coordinating with Russia and China against U.S. maximalism at one point). The viability of Europe’s independent diplomacy is higher when it has tangible leverage – which is why the economic and military empowerment discussed earlier is crucial. With that leverage, Europe can be the _convener_ or mediator of dialogues between East and West. Already, leaders like President Macron and Chancellor Scholz have maintained communication with China’s Xi and even with Putin (controversially) to keep European perspectives in play. The Plan should refine Europe’s diplomatic posture as one of **“strategic autonomy”**: working with any partner case-by-case, guided by European-defined principles and interests. This echoes the concept of Europe as a “center of gravity” in a multipolar world, championed by some foreign policy experts. It also resonates with patterns of rise and decline: if Europe can avoid being a pawn of stronger powers and instead position itself as an indispensable partner to many, it increases its own importance.

**Deepening Ties with Turkey, Mexico, Canada, and Australia:** These four are disparate countries, but each offers unique value to a Europe-first grand strategy. Strengthening relations with them is diplomatically viable and, in many cases, already underway:

- **Turkey:** Turkey straddles Europe and the Middle East and holds NATO’s second-largest army. While EU-Turkey relations have been strained (Turkey’s EU accession bid is frozen, disputes over human rights and regional issues persist), Turkey remains a critical player in European security (migration control, Black Sea security, Middle East stability). The Plan’s suggestion to deepen ties with Turkey could involve a pragmatic bargain: Europe can offer economic incentives (upgrading the customs union, investment, cooperation in tech and energy) and include Turkey in security dialogues, in exchange for Turkey aligning more with European interests (for instance, Sweden’s NATO accession or moderating tensions in the Eastern Med). Historically, Turkey has oscillated between looking West and East; a Europe more independent from the U.S. might appeal to Turkish strategic thinkers who chafe at U.S. policies but could engage with a Europe that treats Turkey as an equal partner. There are risks – Turkey’s current leadership under President Erdoğan has been transactional and at times at odds with EU values. But even so, Turkey has collaborated closely with Europe on issues like the refugee deal of 2016, showing partnership is possible when interests meet. Citing scholarly views, a stable entente with Turkey would greatly increase Europe’s geopolitical reach (in the Caucasus, Middle East, and North Africa) and prevent adversaries (Russia, for one) from driving a wedge between Turkey and the West. Therefore, the Plan can push for re-engaging Turkey through high-level strategic summits and new agreements, while urging reforms and confidence-building on both sides. This is seen as plausible by many experts if approached after Turkey’s election cycle, etc., when conditions may be better.

- **Mexico:** Mexico is often overlooked in European foreign policy, but it is Latin America’s second-largest economy and has a population of 130 million. It’s also next door to the U.S., which adds an interesting dimension – a closer Europe-Mexico relationship subtly balances U.S. dominance in the Western Hemisphere. The EU and Mexico have a modernized FTA (pending full ratification) which will remove practically all tariffs and open services and government procurement. That agreement, once in force, will solidify economic ties. Diplomatically, Mexico is a key player in the UN (it was on the Security Council in 2021-22) and often takes independent stances. An alliance with Mexico can help Europe work with the “Global South” bloc, as Mexico bridges North-South perspectives (it is part of both the OECD and a leading voice in Latin America). There is historical goodwill – Mexico was one of the first countries to sign a cooperation agreement with the then-European Community in 1997, and both share values like multilateralism. By investing in this partnership (through cultural exchange, development cooperation in Central America, etc.), Europe can gain a partner that amplifies its voice across the Atlantic. It also signals Europe’s global outreach beyond its immediate neighborhood. The Plan should highlight cooperation areas like climate change (Mexico has large renewable potential and interest in green tech), anti-drug trafficking strategies, and support for democracy (both have an interest in strengthening democratic governance regionally). Such ties carry minimal risk – the U.S. is unlikely to object to EU-Mexico closeness as long as it’s not anti-American, and it mostly isn’t; rather it diversifies Mexico’s options which even Mexico would welcome given its overreliance on the U.S. market.

- **Canada:** Canada is one of Europe’s closest cultural and political cousins. It is a NATO ally, and through CETA it has burgeoning trade with the EU. Deepening ties here is almost straightforward – cooperation is already strong in areas like defense (Canadian troops are part of NATO’s battlegroups in Eastern Europe), international law, and environmental policy. Canada often aligns with EU positions at the UN and other forums, and both are committed to the multilateral order. A specific strategic benefit is Canada’s Arctic presence: as the Arctic opens up, the EU (which has member states like Finland and an Arctic policy) and Canada can coordinate on keeping that region stable and preventing excessive Russian or Chinese influence there. Additionally, Canada is rich in critical minerals and energy; Europe partnering with Canada (a reliable supplier) fits the energy independence and supply chain resilience agenda. The risk here is nil – the U.S. encourages its allies to work together. In fact, by tightening EU-Canada collaboration, the Western alliance network becomes more resilient, which is in line with European strategic autonomy (autonomy does not mean isolation, but the freedom to build one’s own coalition of choice).

- **Australia:** Australia, like Canada, is a like-minded middle power. The EU and Australia have been negotiating a free trade agreement (talks recently hit some roadblocks over agriculture, but likely to conclude eventually), and they already cooperate on security (Australia participates in EU missions and dialogues, and the two signed a Framework Agreement in 2017 to broaden ties). From Europe’s perspective, a stronger relationship with Australia extends its influence in the Indo-Pacific without having to project military force there directly. Australia is part of AUKUS and the Quad, aligning with the U.S. and India in balancing China. By engaging Australia, Europe ensures it has eyes and ears in Indo-Pacific security discussions and can coordinate on issues like freedom of navigation, cyber security, and countering coercive economics (Australia faced Chinese trade sanctions in recent years and worked with Europe to address them). There is mutual benefit: Australia wants diverse partners beyond just the U.S., and Europe wants to support allies in a region critical to global trade. A risk was Australia’s cancellation of a French submarine deal in favor of AUKUS – that strained France-Australia ties. But since then, they have mended relations, and Europe as a whole is keen on an Indo-Pacific strategy that includes democratic partners like Australia, Japan, India, etc. The Plan can propose an annual EU-Australia summit and security cooperation (perhaps invite Australia to more joint exercises or intelligence sharing arrangements). This deepening doesn’t undermine European autonomy; rather it’s an example of Europe proactively building the alliances _it_ chooses, not merely inheriting U.S.-led partnerships.

In essence, strengthening ties with these countries – Turkey, Mexico, Canada, Australia – is about Europe broadening its strategic horizon. It reduces the chance of Europe being isolated or encircled in any global power play. Each partnership adds to Europe’s bargaining chips: with Turkey, influence in its neighborhood; with Mexico, a say in the Americas; with Canada and Australia, reach into the Arctic and Indo-Pacific, respectively. Diplomatically, these ties buttress Europe’s image as a global actor with its own network, not just a junior partner to the U.S. or an inward-looking bloc. Academic analyses of EU foreign policy often talk about the EU as a “normative power” that exports values. By allying with these democracies, Europe strengthens a global coalition for democracy and rule of law – showing that European values have resonance worldwide. It also reflects **“strategic interdependence”**, where Europe increases interdependence with allies to become collectively stronger ([Onwards and outwards: Why the EU needs to move from strategic autonomy to strategic interdependence | ECFR](https://ecfr.eu/article/onwards-and-outwards-why-the-eu-needs-to-move-from-strategic-autonomy-to-strategic-interdependence/#:~:text=The%20new%20geopolitical%20context%20has,how%20to%20depend%20on%20whom)) ([Onwards and outwards: Why the EU needs to move from strategic autonomy to strategic interdependence | ECFR](https://ecfr.eu/article/onwards-and-outwards-why-the-eu-needs-to-move-from-strategic-autonomy-to-strategic-interdependence/#:~:text=on%20whom)). The Plan’s diplomatic viability is enhanced by emphasizing that these partnerships are _two-way streets_ – Europe should also be prepared to support these partners (e.g., support Mexico’s development efforts in Central America, support Australia’s stance in Pacific disputes, etc.). Reciprocity builds trust.

Finally, balancing all these relations (with great powers and regional partners) requires Europe to improve its foreign policy decision-making. One academic critique is that the EU lacks a **“coherent and proactive”** foreign policy due to the need for consensus and differing national interests ([Priorities for the EU's New Foreign Policy Agenda up to 2024 | DGAP](https://dgap.org/en/research/publications/priorities-eus-new-foreign-policy-agenda-2024#:~:text=Priorities%20for%20the%20EU%27s%20New,policy%20as%20a%20core)) ([Judy Asks: Can Europe Influence U.S.-China Rivalry? | Carnegie Endowment for International Peace](https://carnegieendowment.org/europe/strategic-europe/2023/02/judy-asks-can-europe-influence-us-china-rivalry?lang=en#:~:text=It%20is%20hard%20to%20think,increasingly%20sidelined%20in%20this%20debate)). To implement the Plan, the EU may need internal reforms, such as moving toward qualified majority voting in certain foreign policy areas or having an empowered EU High Representative with a clearer mandate. This is implied in the need to ensure Europe “dictates terms rather than being sidelined” in negotiations – it must first be united to do so. If Europe can manage that internally, externally it has all the diplomatic tools: economic clout, developmental aid, a large diplomatic network, and cultural influence. The Plan’s vision of Europe as a power that balances between major blocs while championing its own interests is optimistic but grounded in a reading of current trends that many scholars share: the world is becoming more multipolar, and Europe has a window of opportunity **now** (especially as the U.S. focuses on Asia and is sometimes erratic in commitments) to step up as an autonomous pole ([How would Europe defend itself? - Defense Priorities](https://www.defensepriorities.org/explainers/how-would-europe-defend-itself/#:~:text=should%20not%20be%20construed%20as,to%20achieve%20full%20defensive%20autonomy)) ([How would Europe defend itself? - Defense Priorities](https://www.defensepriorities.org/explainers/how-would-europe-defend-itself/#:~:text=either%20British%20or%20French%20nuclear,a%20more%20robust%20threat%20to)).

## Strategic Leverage and Bargaining Power

To move from a reactive posture to proactively shaping global outcomes, Europe must effectively deploy the **strategic “attack vectors”** at its disposal – not military attacks, but tools of influence and pressure in the economic, technological, and diplomatic realms. The European Resurgence Plan rightly seeks ways for Europe to exert pressure on competitors and dictate terms in negotiations. Academic studies in international economics and strategy often refer to these as _geo-economic instruments_ or _leverage capabilities_. Europe’s size and integrated market give it formidable leverage if used in a unified manner.

**Trade and Financial Leverage:** The European Union is the world’s largest trading bloc, and access to its single market is a prize for any trading nation. This grants Europe a powerful bargaining chip. For example, when confronted with unfair trade practices, the EU can threaten **tariffs or market restrictions** that carry massive weight – as it did by launching a probe into Chinese electric vehicle subsidies, signaling potential tariffs ([The EU has a playbook to de-risk from China. Is it working?](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-eu-has-a-playbook-to-de-risk-from-china-is-it-working/#:~:text=The%20European%20Union%E2%80%99s%20,later%20embraced%20by%20the%20Biden)). Knowing that the EU market is indispensable (for China, the EU is a top export destination ([EU trade relations with China - European Union](https://policy.trade.ec.europa.eu/eu-trade-relationships-country-and-region/countries-and-regions/china_en#:~:text=China%20is%20the%20EU%27s%20second,reaching%20%E2%82%AC739%20billion%20in%202023))), such measures compel attention. The EU has also wielded its trade power in positive ways: offering deeper market access or tariffs cuts through FTAs as an incentive for partners to adopt certain standards (like labor or environmental provisions). This _carrot-and-stick_ approach means Europe can set terms: nations often adjust to EU standards to avoid losing access. The concept known as the **“Brussels Effect”** encapsulates how companies worldwide comply with EU regulations voluntarily, effectively letting Europe **“dictate terms”** in global regulations without even needing a negotiation ([The European Union in a globalised world: the "Brussels effect"](https://geopolitique.eu/en/articles/the-european-union-in-a-globalised-world-the-brussels-effect/#:~:text=The%20European%20Union%20in%20a,its%20unilateral%20global%20regulatory%20power)). A concrete instance is EU data privacy rules (GDPR) influencing big tech globally – U.S. firms changed practices to meet EU terms, because losing the EU market was not an option. Similarly, Europe’s new regulations on digital markets and AI are likely to shape international norms. In finance, the EU (and allied European states like the UK) control key infrastructure like the SWIFT messaging network for global payments. When the EU joined the U.S. in sanctioning Russia in 2022, banning key Russian banks from SWIFT, it crippled Russia’s ability to transact internationally ([Europe’s messy Russian gas divorce](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/europes-messy-russian-gas-divorce/#:~:text=country%E2%80%99s%20revenues%20,results%20have%20been%20mostly%20mixed)) ([Europe’s messy Russian gas divorce](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/europes-messy-russian-gas-divorce/#:~:text=voluntary%2015,difficulty%20of%20replacing%20gas%20across)). **Sanctions and asset freezes** are a leverage tool Europe has honed: against Iran, Russia, and others. Given that the euro and European financial centers (London, Frankfurt, Paris) are central to global finance, Europe can cause significant economic disruption to adversaries – or conversely, promise inclusion and investment to those who cooperate. The Plan should underscore Europe’s success in using financial sanctions to pressure Russia’s economy (Russia’s oil exports and revenues have taken a hit due to EU oil embargoes and price caps ([Europe’s messy Russian gas divorce](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/europes-messy-russian-gas-divorce/#:~:text=By%20late%20September%2C%20Russian%20supply,TurkStream%20pipeline%2C%20but%20the%20Nord)) ([Europe’s messy Russian gas divorce](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/europes-messy-russian-gas-divorce/#:~:text=country%E2%80%99s%20revenues%20,results%20have%20been%20mostly%20mixed))). It can do similarly with others if needed: e.g., restrict Chinese banks’ access to euros or European operations if China flagrantly violated sanctions on Russia or threatened EU security. On the flip side, Europe can leverage financial incentives, such as offering development loans or access to its capital markets, to sway countries. For instance, the EU is a top donor and lender in many regions; aligning that aid with strategic goals (without being coercive) is a way to win influence.

Another burgeoning tool is the **Euro as a global currency**. While the euro is second to the dollar, efforts to internationalize it (e.g., via more euro-denominated energy contracts and digital euro development) could increase Europe’s financial autonomy from U.S. monetary policy and sanctions. Already, after the U.S.’s unilateral Iran sanctions penalized European companies (due to dollar dominance), the EU created INSTEX as a workaround (though limited in success). This shows awareness that controlling financial channels is key to autonomy. If Europe can strengthen the euro’s international role, it could **“set the terms”** more often in global finance – for example, pricing critical commodities in euros, which would give European regulators oversight of those transactions.

**Technological and Standard-Setting Leverage:** Europe’s technological leverage lies in specific niches and in its regulatory oversight of technology. For instance, Europe (specifically the Netherlands-based ASML company) has near-monopoly in advanced lithography machines needed to manufacture cutting-edge semiconductors. Recognizing this leverage, the Dutch (supported by EU and U.S. pressure) decided to **block exports of certain chip-making equipment to China**, significantly constraining China’s technological capabilities. This is a prime example of how Europe can use a **technology chokepoint** to exert pressure: by denying or conditioning access to critical tech, Europe can influence a rival’s behavior. The Plan can identify other such chokepoints Europe controls or could develop – for example, Europe’s aerospace tech (Airbus could limit sales of aircraft or parts to countries acting against EU security interests), or pharmaceutical patents (EU-based companies could withhold new medicines). Naturally, such moves are extreme and not taken lightly, as they also have commercial costs, but having the _option_ gives Europe bargaining power. Additionally, Europe leads in setting **standards** in telecom (e.g., 5G standards had heavy European input via Ericsson/Nokia’s involvement), in chemicals (the EU’s REACH standards compel foreign firms to reformulate products to be sold in Europe), and is trying to do so in emerging fields like AI ethics. Setting standards often means the first mover’s rules become global default – thus, if Europe gets ahead on, say, blockchain regulations or quantum encryption protocols, it can later insist others follow its frameworks to interoperate. This proactive standard-setting is a subtle yet potent form of leverage: it’s easier to ask others to meet your standards than to adjust to theirs. The Plan should encourage the EU to continue being a regulatory superpower, as scholars like Anu Bradford highlight, because it’s one of Europe’s distinct strengths ([The European Union in a globalised world: the "Brussels effect"](https://geopolitique.eu/en/articles/the-european-union-in-a-globalised-world-the-brussels-effect/#:~:text=The%20European%20Union%20in%20a,its%20unilateral%20global%20regulatory%20power)). By the time others catch up, they have to play by Europe’s rules or be locked out of its market, which few can afford.

**Exerting Pressure on China, the U.S., and Russia:** Each of these major competitors/allies can be influenced by different means. For **China**, Europe’s leverage is primarily economic and technological. China needs the European market and high-tech imports. As one analysis put it, **“China will continue to need foreign technologies and markets to support its huge economy, and without the United States, Europe’s share of influence grows.”** ([Europe's Economic Leverage Over China - American Security Project](https://www.americansecurityproject.org/europes-economic-leverage-over-china/#:~:text=Europe%27s%20Economic%20Leverage%20Over%20China,Europe%27s%20share%20of%20influence%20grows)). In other words, if the U.S. curtails tech exchange with China (as it has with export controls), China becomes even more reliant on Europe for certain advanced goods and scientific collaboration. Europe can use this position to demand reciprocity – for example, pressing China to open its markets more to European companies or to adhere to intellectual property rules, by threatening to cut off remaining tech exports or investments. Europe demonstrated willingness to push back by sanctioning Chinese officials over Uyghur human rights abuses in 2021 and by preparing the EV tariffs in 2023. Beijing took notice, retaliating minimally on the former and actively lobbying against the latter – a sign that Europe’s actions cause China to modify its approach (indeed, China recently courted Europe with promises of a more open business environment, partly to prevent a transatlantic front against it). For **the United States**, Europe’s leverage is more about alliance value and markets. The EU can leverage its importance to U.S. geopolitical goals: Washington needs Europe’s support to manage Russia and to share the burden globally. Europe could, for instance, be more assertive in linking its cooperation to U.S. consideration of EU interests. A scenario: if a future U.S. administration were to threaten economic penalties on the EU (like tariffs), the EU could remind the U.S. that cooperation on security or vis-à-vis China might be withheld or scaled down in response. Additionally, Europe’s huge defense procurement plans (like Germany’s recent military modernization) means big contracts for U.S. defense firms – the EU could choose to favor European suppliers, which indirectly pressures the U.S. to treat Europe as a partner not subordinate. On trade, the EU can and has retaliated against U.S. tariffs (e.g., in the steel/aluminum tariff spat, the EU imposed counter-tariffs to force negotiations). Financially, if the EU develops alternatives to U.S.-centric systems (as discussed), it reduces U.S. unilateral sanction power – that itself pressures the U.S. to coordinate more with EU rather than act unilaterally. While confrontation with the U.S. is not desirable, asserting **“strategic responsibility”** within the alliance can actually rebalance it healthily ([Strategic responsibility: Rebalancing European and trans-Atlantic ...](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/strategic-responsibility-rebalancing-european-and-trans-atlantic-defense/#:~:text=Strategic%20responsibility%3A%20Rebalancing%20European%20and,to%20strengthen%20the%20Atlantic%20alliance)) ([Defending Europe with less America | ECFR](https://ecfr.eu/publication/defending-europe-with-less-america/#:~:text=Defending%20Europe%20with%20less%20America,defend%20Europe%20with%20less%20America)). A Brookings analysis suggests Europe taking more responsibility will give it greater say ([Strategic responsibility: Rebalancing European and trans-Atlantic ...](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/strategic-responsibility-rebalancing-european-and-trans-atlantic-defense/#:~:text=Strategic%20responsibility%3A%20Rebalancing%20European%20and,to%20strengthen%20the%20Atlantic%20alliance)), which is leverage in itself.

For **Russia**, Europe’s leverage has been clearly demonstrated: energy was once Russia’s trump card, but by cutting dependence and imposing sanctions, Europe turned the tables. Russia’s economy is reeling from lost European markets (its gas sales to Europe will never fully recover, costing it revenue, and oil is sold at a discount due to EU-led price caps ([Europe’s messy Russian gas divorce](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/europes-messy-russian-gas-divorce/#:~:text=venture%20with%20a%2051,bcm%20per%20year%2C%20Nord%20Stream)) ([Europe’s messy Russian gas divorce](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/europes-messy-russian-gas-divorce/#:~:text=more%20than%2040,on%20Russian%20oil%20narrowed%20as))). Continued sanctions and the prospect of their tightening keep pressure on Moscow’s war financing. Furthermore, the EU’s potential enlargement to include Ukraine (and others) would strategically encircle Russia with a unified bloc, something Russia strongly wished to prevent. Europe can use the _carrot_ of eventual sanctions relief or normalized relations as leverage – making clear that only if Russia ceases aggression and agrees to a just peace will it regain access to Europe’s markets and capital. This is a powerful incentive, given Europe was Russia’s largest economic partner by far pre-war. If and when diplomacy resumes, Europe will be a key negotiator precisely because it controls much of Russia’s economic lifelines.

**Structuring Negotiations to Europe’s Advantage:** To ensure Europe _dictates terms_ rather than being sidelined, the EU must be united and often take the initiative. One tactic is **agenda-setting** – coming to negotiations with a clear European proposal that frames the discussion. For instance, in climate negotiations (COP conferences), the EU has often led with ambitious targets, pushing others to respond to its level. In trade, the EU did this with data protection and digital tax discussions. By putting forward concrete plans (e.g., an EU-China investment agreement draft that sets standards), Europe can move talks onto its terrain. Unity is paramount: if external powers sense division, they will pick off individual states with side deals. The EU’s strength in trade talks is that it negotiates as one; applying this to foreign policy, Europe could cultivate more coordination through mechanisms like joint statements, common strategies (the recent **EU Strategic Compass** is a step in that direction, defining common threat perceptions and tasks). Also, **smaller “coalitions of the willing” within Europe** can be utilized to act faster when the whole EU cannot – a Carnegie Europe discussion posited that ad-hoc coalitions for certain crises might stir a more proactive policy ([Judy Asks: Would Coalitions of the Willing Strengthen EU Foreign ...](https://carnegieendowment.org/europe/strategic-europe/2020/09/judy-asks-would-coalitions-of-the-willing-strengthen-eu-foreign-policy?lang=en#:~:text=Judy%20Asks%3A%20Would%20Coalitions%20of,proactive%20foreign%20policy%20by)). This happened with some countries taking lead in naval missions or in expelling Russian diplomats; though not all 27 agreed, the action by many set a de facto European position. Over time, successes by such coalitions can be formalized into EU policy. Another negotiation method is linking issues: Europe can bundle separate negotiations to increase its leverage. For example, if negotiating trade with one power and climate with another, Europe can trade concessions across domains – something only a big actor with diverse competencies like the EU can do effectively.

**Shifting to Proactive Geopolitical Maneuvering:** Historically, the EU has been reactive – crises (Eurozone debt, Crimea invasion, refugee influx) forced responses. The Plan aspires for a proactive stance where Europe _anticipates_ and shapes events. This requires institutionalizing foresight. The EU has started doing **Strategic Foresight reports** annually, scanning future trends, which is useful for planning. The idea of **“strategic autonomy”** itself was a proactive concept, but critics say it was defensive, inward-looking ([Onwards and outwards: Why the EU needs to move from strategic autonomy to strategic interdependence | ECFR](https://ecfr.eu/article/onwards-and-outwards-why-the-eu-needs-to-move-from-strategic-autonomy-to-strategic-interdependence/#:~:text=Strategic%20autonomy%20is%20a%20defensive,with%20its%20allies%20and%20partners)) ([Onwards and outwards: Why the EU needs to move from strategic autonomy to strategic interdependence | ECFR](https://ecfr.eu/article/onwards-and-outwards-why-the-eu-needs-to-move-from-strategic-autonomy-to-strategic-interdependence/#:~:text=The%20new%20geopolitical%20context%20has,how%20to%20depend%20on%20whom)). Some analysts suggest evolving toward **“strategic interdependence”** – proactively building chosen interdependencies to strengthen Europe and its allies ([Onwards and outwards: Why the EU needs to move from strategic autonomy to strategic interdependence | ECFR](https://ecfr.eu/article/onwards-and-outwards-why-the-eu-needs-to-move-from-strategic-autonomy-to-strategic-interdependence/#:~:text=The%20new%20geopolitical%20context%20has,how%20to%20depend%20on%20whom)) ([Onwards and outwards: Why the EU needs to move from strategic autonomy to strategic interdependence | ECFR](https://ecfr.eu/article/onwards-and-outwards-why-the-eu-needs-to-move-from-strategic-autonomy-to-strategic-interdependence/#:~:text=on%20whom)). For example, rather than just cutting ties with adversaries (reactive), Europe should _invest_ in ties with others (proactive) to create a more favorable environment. This means, say, before a crisis hits, Europe has already built supply chain alternatives, or has forged a coalition ready to respond. Being proactive also involves taking calculated risks in leadership – proposing new international initiatives. Europe could convene a conference on, for instance, cyber norms or Arctic governance, setting the agenda rather than waiting to be invited by the U.S. or UN. The EU’s outreach in the Indo-Pacific (with a formal strategy in 2021) is an example of stepping out of its traditional comfort zone preemptively. The Plan might suggest a European Security Council (an idea floated to include the UK in a smaller group with France and Germany for swift decisions) – a proactive structural reform to enable quicker action. Another method is **legal and economic warfare preparedness**: the EU is adopting tools like the Anti-Coercion Instrument (to retaliate against economic coercion) and has a unit to scan disinformation threats. These are defensive but turn defense into deterrence – knowing Europe can and will strike back (economically or via exposure of malign actions) may deter adversaries from attempting coercion in the first place.

In negotiations with superpowers, Europe must project confidence and the willingness to walk away if terms are not acceptable – a classic negotiation leverage. For instance, during Brexit talks, the EU held a firm line and was willing to bear a no-deal scenario; eventually the UK conceded to most EU conditions. This success came from unity and credible commitment to its stance. Applying that to EU-U.S. or EU-China dealings: Europe should identify its non-negotiables (e.g., EU will not accept subsidies that gut its industry, or it won’t abandon support for Taiwan’s democracy in exchange for trade favors) and stick to them. It can do so better if it has reduced its vulnerabilities (hence why the economic measures above strengthen its negotiation hand). When others realize Europe **“means business”**, they will take its positions more seriously rather than sidelining it.

One can cite the observation of a European Parliament foreign affairs coordinator: Europe needs to **“clearly prioritize areas it wants to influence…and build alliances in a game of quid-pro-quo”** ([Judy Asks: Can Europe Influence U.S.-China Rivalry? | Carnegie Endowment for International Peace](https://carnegieendowment.org/europe/strategic-europe/2023/02/judy-asks-can-europe-influence-us-china-rivalry?lang=en#:~:text=In%20the%20end%2C%20for%20Europe%2C,to%20be%20taken%20into%20account)) ([Judy Asks: Can Europe Influence U.S.-China Rivalry? | Carnegie Endowment for International Peace](https://carnegieendowment.org/europe/strategic-europe/2023/02/judy-asks-can-europe-influence-us-china-rivalry?lang=en#:~:text=influence%20in%20its%20favor%2C%20such,to%20be%20taken%20into%20account)). This suggests being strategic in focus (pick battles that matter most) and leveraging alliances (internal and external) to achieve objectives. The Plan can refine itself by incorporating such advice – identify 3-4 top strategic priorities (e.g., secure neighborhood, technological leadership, climate leadership, stable multipolar order) and concentrate proactive efforts there, using bargaining chips as needed. Everything from offering or denying access to the EU market, to providing or withholding development aid, to deploying or not deploying troops, can be seen as a chip to play in diplomacy.

Crucially, to not remain reactive, Europe must also improve communication and crisis response. Setting up something akin to a European “National Security Council” that constantly monitors global hot spots and prepares EU positions could be valuable. Additionally, more investment in **European intelligence and analysis** will allow the EU to anticipate crises (for example, if EU intelligence could predict an impending conflict or coup, Europe might initiate diplomatic interventions early).

In conclusion, Europe has substantial latent leverage. Academic analyses consistently highlight Europe’s **market power, regulatory power, and multi-faceted diplomacy** as underutilized assets that, if coordinated, make the EU a “system-shaping” power. The Resurgence Plan’s emphasis on moving from reactive to proactive aligns with the goal of converting these assets into real influence. By integrating lessons from both successes and failures – the importance of unity (success in trade deals, failure when divided on Iraq 2003), the value of credible threats (success in trade retaliation, failure when red lines are not enforced like in Syria 2013) – the Plan can outline robust methods for Europe to set the agenda. The end result would be negotiations where Europe is at the table as an equal or even chairing the table, rather than being an item on the menu. When Europe can convene discussions (as it did for the Iran deal) or co-lead global initiatives (like the Paris Climate Accord, which was significantly an EU-driven effort), it flips the script from reacting to others’ proposals to others reacting to Europe’s. This proactive posture, backed by hard and soft power, would fulfill the Plan’s vision of Europe as a confident geopolitical actor that **dictates terms** in line with its interests and values – a far cry from the era of being seen as an economic giant but political dwarf. With academic rigor supporting each instrument – from trade defenses ([The EU has a playbook to de-risk from China.

# Conclusion

The European Resurgence Plan, when scrutinized against historical evidence and scholarly analysis, emerges as an ambitious yet achievable roadmap for elevating Europe’s role on the world stage. Militarily, Europe can attain far greater autonomy by investing in capabilities and unity, though complete independence from NATO is a long-term project that must proceed pragmatically and in phases. Historical attempts at European defense integration counsel patience and the necessity of political will, while contemporary security analyses underscore that Europe must first plug critical capability gaps to credibly deter threats on its own ([What European NATO Lacks - CEPA](https://cepa.org/article/what-european-nato-lacks/#:~:text=these%2C%20European%20forces%20would%20struggle,sustain%20operations%20on%20their%20own)) ([How would Europe defend itself? - Defense Priorities](https://www.defensepriorities.org/explainers/how-would-europe-defend-itself/#:~:text=role%20in%20NATO%20regardless%20of,be%20an%20important%20test%20case)). The Plan’s military proposals are strengthened by incorporating these insights – advocating a stepwise build-up of a unified European defense (through mechanisms like PESCO and joint commands) and leveraging France’s nuclear arsenal as a continental deterrent within legal bounds ([](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_3605227_1/component/file_3605228/content#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20options%3F%20There,of%20the%20French%20arsenal%20would)) ([France Offers Nuclear Deterrent to All Europe | Arms Control Association](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2020-03/news/france-offers-nuclear-deterrent-all-europe#:~:text=French%20President%20Emmanuel%20Macron%20offered,play%20in%20their%20collective%20security)). Economically, the Plan’s push for energy independence, supply chain resilience, and technological sovereignty finds robust support in recent events and economic theory. Europe has already begun decoupling from unreliable suppliers (reducing Russian gas to under 15% of its supply) ([Europe’s messy Russian gas divorce](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/europes-messy-russian-gas-divorce/#:~:text=Europe%20still%20imported%2014.8,Europe%E2%80%99s%20total%20gas%20supply%20came)) ([Europe’s messy Russian gas divorce](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/europes-messy-russian-gas-divorce/#:~:text=By%20late%20September%2C%20Russian%20supply,TurkStream%20pipeline%2C%20but%20the%20Nord)) and accelerating renewables investment as both a climate measure and a security imperative ([Renewable energy | European Environment Agency's home page](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/topics/in-depth/renewable-energy#:~:text=energy%20system%20have%20decreased%20steadily,European%20Union%E2%80%99s%20final%20energy%20use)) ([Renewable energy | European Environment Agency's home page](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/topics/in-depth/renewable-energy#:~:text=While%20not%20without%20impact%2C%20replacing,to%20increasing%20Europe%E2%80%99s%20energy%20independence)). By following through on this trajectory – diversifying energy sources, championing green tech, and judiciously reshoring critical industries – Europe can shield itself from external economic coercion while spurring innovation at home. Industrial policy done smartly, as the Plan recommends, will avoid protectionist pitfalls by focusing on competitiveness and collaboration (evoking successes like Airbus) ([European Industrial Policy in the 2020s: Rationale, Challenges and Limitations - Intereconomics](https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2024/number/5/article/european-industrial-policy-in-the-2020s-rationale-challenges-and-limitations.html#:~:text=While%20the%20case%20for%20industrial,to%20create%20a%20domestic%20automobile)). In recalibrating the transatlantic and Sino-European economic relationships, the Plan heeds scholarly advice to **“de-risk”** rather than fully decouple ([The EU has a playbook to de-risk from China. Is it working?](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-eu-has-a-playbook-to-de-risk-from-china-is-it-working/#:~:text=The%20European%20Union%E2%80%99s%20,later%20embraced%20by%20the%20Biden)) ([The EU has a playbook to de-risk from China.

Diplomatically, Europe’s renewed assertiveness is both necessary and viable. The history of great powers teaches that Europe’s future influence hinges on unity and strategic clarity – a lesson the Plan embeds by calling for a more coherent EU foreign policy and equitable partnerships abroad. Engaging Africa as an equal partner marks a definitive break with Europe’s colonial legacy, aligning with contemporary expectations for respect and mutual benefit ([What a True Partnership of Equals Would Mean for the European Union and African Union | Center For Global Development](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/what-true-partnership-equals-would-mean-european-union-and-african-union#:~:text=Africa%E2%80%99s%20future%20requires%20bold%20and,European%20knowledge%2C%20experience%2C%20and%20expertise)) ([What a True Partnership of Equals Would Mean for the European Union and African Union | Center For Global Development](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/what-true-partnership-equals-would-mean-european-union-and-african-union#:~:text=The%20power%20dynamics%20between%20Europe,the%20EU%E2%80%99s%20strategies%20and%20policies)). Similarly, balancing relations with the U.S., China, Russia, and emerging powers allows Europe to pursue its own interests first, acting neither as a junior ally nor a passive bystander. This strategy of **“strategic autonomy”**, refined to **“strategic interdependence”** with trusted partners ([Onwards and outwards: Why the EU needs to move from strategic autonomy to strategic interdependence | ECFR](https://ecfr.eu/article/onwards-and-outwards-why-the-eu-needs-to-move-from-strategic-autonomy-to-strategic-interdependence/#:~:text=The%20new%20geopolitical%20context%20has,how%20to%20depend%20on%20whom)), positions Europe as a shaper of global norms through persuasion rather than dominance. By deepening ties with countries like Turkey, Mexico, Canada, and Australia, Europe expands its diplomatic network and reduces over-reliance on any single alliance, a move well-grounded in alliance theory and the practice of multipolar diplomacy. These partnerships, as the Plan details, enhance Europe’s influence in various regions and issues – from Arctic security to Indo-Pacific trade – reinforcing the notion that Europe’s diplomatic weight is maximized when it engages globally on its own terms.

Finally, in terms of strategic leverage, the Plan rightly identifies that Europe must better employ the tools already at its disposal. The EU’s immense single market, regulatory might, and financial power are formidable leverage points that can be applied to advance Europe’s objectives vis-à-vis any competitor ([Europe's Economic Leverage Over China - American Security Project](https://www.americansecurityproject.org/europes-economic-leverage-over-china/#:~:text=Europe%27s%20Economic%20Leverage%20Over%20China,Europe%27s%20share%20of%20influence%20grows)) ([The European Union in a globalised world: the "Brussels effect"](https://geopolitique.eu/en/articles/the-european-union-in-a-globalised-world-the-brussels-effect/#:~:text=The%20European%20Union%20in%20a,its%20unilateral%20global%20regulatory%20power)). The Plan’s recommendations to use trade and investment policy proactively (rewarding partners, pressuring rule-breakers) and to develop defensive instruments against economic coercion are validated by recent successful examples – such as EU sanctions constraining Russia’s war effort ([Europe’s messy Russian gas divorce](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/europes-messy-russian-gas-divorce/#:~:text=country%E2%80%99s%20revenues%20,results%20have%20been%20mostly%20mixed)) and the credible threat of tariffs inducing trading partners to negotiate fairer terms ([The EU has a playbook to de-risk from China. Is it working?](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-eu-has-a-playbook-to-de-risk-from-china-is-it-working/#:~:text=The%20European%20Union%E2%80%99s%20,later%20embraced%20by%20the%20Biden)). To transition from reactive to proactive, the Plan incorporates institutional improvements (like more agile decision-making and foresight capabilities) and a mindset shift toward confidence in EU bargaining power. No longer should Europe wait for others to set the agenda; instead, it will convene and lead on issues where it has expertise and stakes – whether climate action, digital governance, or conflict mediation. By implementing the Plan’s strategy of tying together Europe’s values (democracy, rule of law, sustainability) with its real leverage (market access, aid, security guarantees), Europe can negotiate from a position of principled strength, often **“dictating terms”** simply because it has set the standards that others aspire to ([The European Union in a globalised world: the "Brussels effect"](https://geopolitique.eu/en/articles/the-european-union-in-a-globalised-world-the-brussels-effect/#:~:text=The%20European%20Union%20in%20a,its%20unilateral%20global%20regulatory%20power)).

In refining the original blueprint of the European Resurgence Plan, this analysis has injected doses of realism – acknowledging legal constraints like the NPT on a Euro-nuclear force, or the economic cost of reshoring – but also highlighted the wealth of scholarly and historical evidence that supports the Plan’s fundamental premise: a more unified and self-reliant Europe is not only possible, it is imperative. The 21st century’s challenges and power shifts make it clear that Europe can neither cling to an outsized reliance on allies nor retreat into isolation. Instead, it must become an autonomous pillar of the international order, alongside other great powers. The Plan, buttressed by academic rigor here, charts a course for Europe to do exactly that: **militarily deter threats largely by itself, economically stand on its own feet, diplomatically lead in its neighborhoods and beyond, and strategically leverage its unified power to shape outcomes.** Each element is grounded in evidence – from case studies of past unifications to models of economic autonomy – lending the Plan credibility and weight.

If executed with commitment, the European Resurgence Plan would transform the EU from a “consumer” of security and rules into a “producer” of them, securing its interests and values in an era of renewed great-power competition. Europe’s resurgence would also benefit the broader international community: a strong Europe can anchor stability, advocate for multilateral solutions, and balance global power equitably. In sum, the academically validated proposals in this policy paper strengthen the original plan’s legitimacy and practicality. The road ahead requires political will and unity among Europeans, but the destination – a Europe that is robustly sovereign and influential – is a realistic and worthy ambition. History has shown Europe’s capacity for reinvention, and now, armed with scholarly insight and strategic clarity, Europe can write a new chapter as a confident, capable great power in its own right.
